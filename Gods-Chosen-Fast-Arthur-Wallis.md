### Preface

n a large city I inquired of all the Christian bookstores for some
publication on the subject of fasting. They could not suggest a
single title. A few days afterwards in a health food store in the
same city, I picked up a book on health fasting. I soon discovered
that there was far more being written on the physical aspect of this
subject by food reformists than on the spiritual aspect by Christian
writers. Later I was thankful to come across Gordon Cove’s book
*Revival Now Through Prayer and Fasting, and a booklet by David*
*Smith, Some Light on Fasting, containing helpful teaching and wise*
counsel. Apart from two or three American publications, there
appeared to be nothing else in print.
Having proved the great value and blessing of fasting over many
years, I was concerned that so many earnest believers had
apparently never given the subject any serious thought. This concern
became a constraint to share with those who hunger for God’s best,
what the Bible has to say about this spiritual exercise. My aim has
been to furnish a handbook which would not only deal with the main
passages in the Scripture that touch on the subject, including a
biblical index, but to deal as fully as possible with the practical issues
involved.
In the section of the book dealing with the physical and practical
side, more space has been given to the longer fast, as a proper
understanding of the physical aspect is so important. This should not
lead the reader to suppose that everyone is called to undertake
lengthy fasts, or that the shorter fast is of comparatively little value.
This is by no means the case. Nevertheless, it is helpful for those
who practice only the briefest fasting to understand the body’s
behavior in the longer fast.
Of course, the discussion of this physical side is the province of
the physician rather than of the Bible student. Here I must record my
indebtedness to the writings of Dr. Otto Buchinger of Germany and
Dr. Herbert Shelton of San Antonio, Texas, both experts in the field
of therapeutic fasting, as well as to those friends in the medical
profession who kindly read the manuscript and carefully vetted what
I have said on this side of the subject. I am most grateful to them and
to others who have offered many helpful suggestions. I am also

---

indebted to the late Professor James Orr for his article on asceticism
*in The Protestant Dictionary, and to the author of the article on*
*fasting in Hastings Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.*
The neglect of truth followed by its rediscovery often results in its
overemphasis. I have been aware of this temptation in connection
with this subject and have therefore tried to give to this theme the
weight that Scripture gives to it. Truth is like a portrait, and to
exaggerate one feature is to turn the portrait into a caricature of the
truth. The result is that thoughtful people turn from this divinely
appointed means of grace as something for the crank or the fanatic.
*Fasting is important—more important, perhaps, than many of us*
have supposed, as I trust this book will reveal. For all that, it is not a
major biblical doctrine, a foundation stone of the faith, or a panacea
for every spiritual ill. Nevertheless, when exercised with a pure heart
and a right motive, fasting may provide us with a key to unlock doors
where other keys have failed; a window opening up new horizons in
the unseen world; a spiritual weapon of God’s providing, “mighty, to
the pulling down of strongholds.” May God use this book to awaken
many of His people to all the spiritual possibilities latent in the fast
that God has chosen.

### Why Fast?

or nearly a century and a half, fasting has been out of vogue, at
least in the churches of the West. The very idea of someone
actually fasting today seems strange to most twentieth-century
Christians. They associate it with medieval Christianity, or perhaps
with High Church practice. They may recall that political leaders, like
Mahatma Ghandi, have used it as a weapon of passive resistance.
As a spiritual exercise, it is confined, they would think, to believers
who appear to be a little extreme or fanatical.
There are others whose misgivings concern the practical aspect.
To them fasting and starving are synonymous terms, and they fear it
will have harmful results. Because “no man ever hates his own flesh,
but nourishes and cherishes it” (Eph. 5:29), they oppose fasting
almost instinctively. “Do be careful,” they say. “You could seriously
impair your health. Living such a busy life you cannot afford to get
run down!”
Why such attitudes to a practice that is so obviously scriptural?
One answer is that fasting was one of the dominant features of an
asceticism which began to appear in the post-apostolic age and
became extreme in form as well as widespread in influence in
medieval times. The pendulum began to swing the other way as
people revolted against anything that savored of asceticism. The
church today is still suffering from that reaction. We have not yet
recovered the spiritual balance of New Testament Christianity.
The writer heard an able Bible teacher give a thought-provoking
address on the reply our Lord gave to a question about fasting. It
was that occasion when He said that the wedding guests would not
fast until the Bridegroom was taken from them. All that the speaker
said was most helpful, but he did not once touch upon the subject of
fasting, or indicate whether it had any place in the economy of the
Christian life today.
When our minds are conditioned by prejudice or paralyzed by
traditional views, we may face a truth in Scripture again and again
without its ever touching us. Our spiritual inhibition concerning that
truth permits us to see, but not to perceive. The truth lies dormant

---

within, mentally apprehended but not spiritually applied. This is
particularly true in relation to fasting.
When, however, such a truth is first ignited by the Holy Spirit,
there is immediate conflict in the minds of most people. The truth of
the Bible has suddenly become “alive and powerful,” and there is an
assault upon our traditional attitudes and prejudices.
The outcome of the struggle reveals whether or not we are open
to receive and obey fresh light about God, and so grow in the
knowledge of the truth. This book is intended to face us with the
question of whether we are prepared to bring our present attitude
about the subject of fasting (or our lack of one) to the acid test of
God’s Word, and then “live according to scripture” (1 Cor. 4:6).
Most of the references to fasting in the Bible are dealt with at
some point in this book. It may surprise the reader, as it certainly did
the writer, to find that Scripture has so much to teach us by example
and by precept about the value of this practice. There are warnings
too, for fasting has its dangers, and we have tried to point these out.
Among great Bible saints who fasted were Moses the lawgiver,
David the king, Elijah the prophet and Daniel the seer. In the New
Testament we have the example of our Lord as well as of His
apostles. It clearly had its place in the life of the early churches. Nor
was this biblical practice confined to men, for we find the names of
Hannah in the Old Testament and Anna in the New Testament in the
ranks of the intercessors who fasted as well as prayed.
Some of the great saints of church history have practiced fasting
and testified to its value, among them the great Reformers, such as
Luther, Calvin and Knox. The custom has not been confined to any
theological school. Here we find Jonathan Edwards the Calvinist
joining hands with John Wesley the Arminian, and David Brainerd
having fellowship with Charles Finney.
These names represent great scholars and preachers, ministers
and missionaries, revivalists and evangelists. We may find on the
fasting list the names of Pastor Hsi of China and Pastor Blumhardt of
Germany, whom God used in their respective spheres a century ago
for the deliverance of those bound by Satan. Time would fail us to
mention the growing number whom God is raising up and using in
the same ministry today through prayer and fasting.

The doings of the great can scarcely be hidden. They are barely
cold in their graves before their biographers are ferreting out their
journals and private diaries. But only the opening of heaven’s
records in that day will reveal the numbers of anonymous saints,
who had no diaries and no biographers, but who prayed with fasting
to the God who sees in secret. They too shall surely shine among
the galaxy of these illustrious saints, “even as the stars for ever and
ever.”
In New Testament times fasting was a channel of power. As
spirituality waned and worldliness flourished in the churches, the
power and gifts of the Spirit were withdrawn. With the loss of that
inward power, men could only cling to what they had left, its outward
accompaniment. More and more emphasis was placed upon the
outward act of fasting, though bereft of the inward spirit that alone
could give it value. Asceticism became the mark of piety and
spirituality. Paul’s prediction about “the form of religion but denying
the power” (2 Tim. 3:5) was being fulfilled.
But, God be praised, a new day is dawning, and a new thirst for
the Spirit is beginning to awaken the slumbering church. It is a day of
spiritual renewal. There are searchings and inquirings, burdens and
longings on every hand. The heart-cry of the church is ascending to
heaven. The Spirit of God is stirring. What is all this but the first
birthpangs of the new age that is soon to be born?
God is determined to have a glorious church without spot or
wrinkle, a bride fit for His beloved Son. It is the conviction of the
writer that, in the travail that will bring to birth, we shall rediscover
one of the lost secrets of the early church: the power that is released
through the truly biblical practice of fasting unto God.

### The Normal Fast

*He fasted forty days and forty nights and afterward he was hungry.*
Matthew 4:2
hen people do not like the plain, literal meaning of something
in the Bible, they are tempted to spiritualize it and so rob it of
its potency. Once the truth becomes nebulous, it ceases to
have any practical application. They have blunted its edge; it can no
longer cut. In the main this is what the professing church, and
evangelicals in particular, have tended to do with the biblical
teaching on fasting.
“To fast,” we are told, “is not simply nor necessarily to abstain
from food, but from anything that hinders our communion with God.”
Or they say, “Fasting means to do without, to practice self-denial.”
We have only to widen the meaning enough, and the cutting edge
has gone.
It is true that there are many things besides food that may hinder
our communion with God. It is also true that we need to practice self-
denial in general. The fact still remains that “to fast” means primarily
“not to eat.”1 We shall see that there were three main forms that
fasting took in Bible times, but each involved literal abstinence. If at
times the word may be widened to include other forms of self-denial,
this does not alter the fact of its basic meaning.
For convenience sake let us call this first and most common form
*the normal fast. What this involved is plain from the first mention of*
fasting in the New Testament: Jesus fasted . . . and afterwards He
was hungry. It meant abstaining from all food, solid or liquid, but not
from water. It seems clear from the details given that our Lord’s fast
was of this type.
We are told that “he ate nothing” (Luke 4:2), but not that He drank
nothing. Afterward it says “he was hungry,” but not that He was
thirsty. Though thirst pangs are more intense than those of hunger,
Satan tempted Him to eat, but not to drink. This all suggests that the
fast was an abstaining from food, but not from water. In fact, the
human body could not survive forty days without water apart from
being supernaturally sustained.

---

There is nothing to suggest that true fasting involves abstaining
from sleep. God may call us to do this for very short periods, such as
giving up a night’s sleep. Paul speaks of “watchings” as distinct from
“fastings” (2 Cor. 6:5; 11:27, KJV.). If abstaining from sleep was
essential to fasting, no long fast would ever be possible apart from
supernatural intervention. The body craves sleep even before water
and is bound to succumb sooner or later, and the fast will be broken
involuntarily.
There is a strong inference in First Corinthians 7:3–5 that the true
fast for married persons includes abstaining also from marital
relations, but this must be by mutual consent. We cannot be
dogmatic here, as it seems certain that the inclusion of the word
“fasting” (7:5) in the text of the King James Version is a gloss and no
part of the original. Nevertheless, the idea of fasting is there.
The normal fast, then, involved abstaining from all forms of food,
but not from water, and must be distinguished from the other two
*forms, the absolute fast and the partial fast, which we must now*
consider.
*Greek nesteuo, from ne, a negative prefix, and esthio, to eat.*
See Appendix I.

### The Absolute Fast

*For three days he . . . neither ate nor drank. Acts 9:9*
e have a few examples in Scripture of what we have called
the absolute fast, that is, abstaining from drinking as well as
eating. Normally this was never for more than three days,
probably because any longer period might have proved physically
injurious. The body can go long periods without food and be
physically benefited, but only for a very short time without water.
We read of Ezra that “he spent the night, neither eating bread nor
drinking water; for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the
exiles” (Ezra 10:6). He was overcome with grief and astonishment at
the shameful compromise of the people in which priests, Levites and
officials had given the lead. He says, “I rent my garments and my
mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled”
(9:3). Overwhelming concern drove him to fast, taking neither food
nor water.
Queen Esther instructed Mordecai, “Hold a fast on my behalf,
and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids
will also fast as you do” (Esther 4:16). A crisis of the utmost gravity
threatened the whole Jewish race with extermination. Even Esther
herself could expect no immunity because she was queen. She
called this absolute fast because desperate situations require
desperate measures.
Saul of Tarsus arrived in Damascus dazed and blinded by his
encounter with the risen Christ. “And for three days he . . . neither
ate nor drank” (Acts 9:9). The spiritual revolution that was taking
place within the young Pharisee was not only to alter the whole
course of his life but to shape the history of the Christian church.
Possibly the upheaval was so great that he never gave food or drink
a thought.
There are examples in Scripture of absolute fasts which must
have been supernatural in character because of their very long
duration. For two separate periods of forty days and forty nights,
Moses was in the presence of God, neither eating nor drinking (Deut.
9:9, 18; Exod. 34:28). The first occasion was when he received the
Ten Commandments from God. The second was immediately

---

following, after discovering the people were worshipping the golden
calf and so had broken the law even before they had formally
received it. These two fasts were undertaken virtually without
intermission, and taken together constitute what is certainly the
longest fast in the Bible, eighty days without food or water.
Then the journey of Elijah to Horeb appears to have been
undertaken during an absolute fast. If so, it must have been
supernatural. Under the juniper tree, where he was sleeping after
escaping from Jezebel, he was awakened by an angel who provided
him with a freshly baked cake and a cruse of water. Twice he was
told to eat and drink, and then he “went in the strength of that food
forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God” (1 Kings
19:8).
A journey of such duration through the burning desert, if it was
completed, as the Scripture implies, without further nourishment,
constitutes an absolute fast quite as supernatural as those of Moses.
If that be so, it is another striking parallel between these two leading
representatives of the old covenant, Moses the giver of the Law and
Elijah its restorer (Mal. 4:4–6; Mark 9:12), for both had a
supernatural ending to their earthly course as well as a supernatural
reappearance with Christ on the holy mount.
Leaving aside such fasts as these which were epoch-making and
supernatural, we conclude that the absolute fast is an exceptional
measure for an exceptional situation. It is something usually
reserved for spiritual emergencies. One knows of extreme cases of
need which have not yielded to normal prayer and fasting, but which
have responded when the intercessor was led by God to fast
absolutely. This is especially true in cases of powerful possession by
evil spirits. One would need to be very sure of the leading of God to
undertake such a fast for any period longer than three days.

### The Partial Fast

*I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth. Daniel 10:3*
he emphasis here is upon restriction of diet rather than complete
abstention. At the commencement of the book of Daniel, we are
introduced to this young man and his three companions. They
had been selected from among the Hebrew exiles because of noble
birth and intellectual attainments for special training, with a view to
serving in the presence of the king of Babylon.
These men resolved not to defile themselves with the king’s rich
food or the wine which he drank, as these would have been first
offered to the Babylonian gods. Instead, they asked for vegetables to
eat and water to drink. The steward set over them agreed to test the
effect of this simple diet for a period of ten days. At the end of this
time, “they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the
youths who ate the king’s rich food” (Dan. 1:15).
Whether or not there was supernatural intervention here is
difficult to tell, but it is a commonly accepted fact of dietetics that a
simple and wholesome diet is far more beneficial than a rich and
elaborate one. Those who move in a circle where there is constant
dining and wining are often beset with ailments caused by excess,
including coronary thrombosis. All forms of fasting, on the other
hand, are physically beneficial, and many who are outside Christian
circles fast for health reasons alone.
The value of the partial fast, however, is not confined by any
means to the physical. Later in the book of Daniel, we read how this
prophet received a revelation from God concerning the future of his
people Israel. He describes how he sought the Lord for
understanding of this vision: “In those days I, Daniel, was mourning
for three weeks. I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my
mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks” (Dan.
10:2–3).
We are not told why he did not engage in a normal fast, as we
find him doing in the previous chapter. Possibly affairs of state or
other circumstances precluded this; or perhaps it was simply that
God guided him otherwise. Undoubtedly there is a definite spiritual
value in a special season of seeking God with such a restricted diet.

---

For Daniel it resulted in a great spiritual victory over the powers of
darkness as well as the unfolding of the vision by an angelic
messenger.
Something akin to a partial fast is seen in the period of Elijah’s
spiritual preparation. At Cherith the raven brought him bread and
meat morning and evening, and he drank from the brook. Later in the
home of the widow at Zarephath, he was sustained with simple
cakes made from meal and oil (1 Kings 17).
Besides the training of this man of God in self-denial,
indispensable to one who is to be entrusted with spiritual power, it
was appropriate that the diet of God’s servant should be the simplest
while there was a famine in the land, and many of his fellow
countrymen were facing starvation. To minister effectively to those in
need, we must be identified with their need and sit where they sit.
A Russian believer deeply impressed a Christian couple when
she went to stay on their farm in England a few years ago.
Miraculously converted, she had been called by God to work for Him
in a displaced persons camp in Austria. She politely declined the
Cornish cream which made its appearance at almost every meal,
and permitted herself only the simplest diet, explaining that she
could not do otherwise when her brothers, sisters and those among
whom she labored were enduring such hardship. God never fails to
honor such self-denial.
Elijah’s counterpart in the New Testament was John the Baptist.
We learn from the gospel records that in addition to fasting often, he
maintained the simplest of diets, subsisting on locusts and wild
honey.
The partial fast allows a great many variations which have been
tried with blessing and benefit. There is the method of living
exclusively on one type of food for the duration of the fast. During his
early days in Georgia, John Wesley adopted a “bread diet,” that is,
living exclusively on dry bread. This was in connection with what he
believed was a case of demon-possession.1
Others have partially fasted by omitting a certain meal each day,
thus strictly limiting the quantity of food consumed. We learn from his
biography that Rees Howells adopted this plan at a time when God
was preparing him for a new work: “He didn’t take dinner for many

---

days . . . but spent the hour with God.”2 Vigilance is needed to
ensure that the value of omitting the one meal is not offset by
increasing the intake at others!
The partial fast is of great value, especially where circumstances
make it impossible or inconvenient to undertake a normal fast.
Certainly it requires no less self-discipline. It can be used as a
steppingstone to the normal fast by those who have never fasted
before. One of its great advantages is that even after being
sustained for a long period, normal eating can be resumed almost at
once, which is not the case with the other two kinds of fasting.
Later we shall notice that under these three main fasts we have
now considered, biblical fasting may be public as well as private,
regular as well as occasional, involuntary as well as voluntary. We
shall notice too the differing needs and circumstances that moved
men to fast, and their application for us today. But first let us
examine the two key statements of our Lord on fasting, for these
must determine our attitude to the whole subject.

### “When”—Not “If”

*When you give alms . . . when you pray . . . when you fast.*
Matthew 6:2, 5, 16
n the great commission Christ commanded His apostles, “Make
disciples of all nations . . . teaching them to observe all that I have
commanded you” (Matt. 28:19–20). There has been for a century
or more a tendency to emphasize and elevate the teaching of the
Epistles in such a way as to suggest that it supersedes the teaching
of Christ as we have it in the Gospels.
Some have even asserted that the teaching of the Sermon on the
Mount has no direct application to believers today, that it is basically
Messianic and Jewish, to be fulfilled in some future millennial age.
This is serious error, and in direct conflict with Christ’s commission
just quoted. If these words have any meaning, it is surely that what
Jesus taught His disciples was to be taught to every successive
generation of disciples, and obeyed, even to the consummation of
the age (see also 1 Tim. 6:3–4).
What did our Lord teach His disciples concerning fasting? That
must surely rule our conduct now. Quoted above is the first of His
two vital utterances on this subject.
In speaking about giving, praying and fasting, Jesus warned His
hearers of the futility of practicing their piety before men to be seen
*by them (Matt. 6: 1-18). He did not say, “If you pray,” as though*
*praying were optional, but, “When you pray,” taking for granted that*
they would recognize prayer as a vital necessity.
*Neither did Jesus say, “If you fast,” as though fasting were*
something that disciples might or might not be led to do, or as
though it only applied to a select few, apostles or prophets,
preachers or leaders. He stated unambiguously, categorically and
*without qualification to the mass of His disciples, “When you fast . . .*
.” He left us in no doubt that He took it for granted that His disciples
would be exercised to obey the leading of the Spirit in this, as in
praying and giving, when the occasion demanded it.
It is significant that the Lord dealt with fasting as a spiritual
exercise distinct from praying. Though fasting and praying are often
linked in Scripture and in experience, this is not necessarily the case.

---

We should not think of fasting as a semi-detached house, always
joined to praying. On the contrary, it stands on its own grounds and
may on occasion serve a spiritual purpose all its own.
Just as there may be praying without fasting, so there may at
times be fasting, truly acceptable to God, without praying—at least in
the sense of intercession. There is no mention of prayer
accompanying the fast we read of in Esther. In the fast of the
prophets and teachers in Antioch, they were giving themselves to
worship rather than prayer (Acts 13:2).
Because one is not able to give oneself to prayer for the whole of
a fast does not mean that the period not accompanied by specific
prayer is devoid of spiritual value. Fasting, as we shall notice later,
has many purposes besides the very important one of facilitating
intercession.

### The Time Is Now

*When the bridegroom is taken from them . . . then they will fast.*
Matthew 9:15
his second important statement of Jesus on fasting came as an
answer to a question of the disciples of John the Baptist: “Why,”
they asked, “do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do
not fast?” Christ’s answer is deeply pertinent to the question of
whether Christians should fast today. He said, “Can the wedding
guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will
come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they
will fast.”
Though there were times when Jesus and His disciples went
hungry or when, due to the demands of the work, they had not
sufficient leisure to eat, there is no evidence that He or they
undertook a definite voluntary fast, other than our Lord’s forty days in
the wilderness prior to the commencement of His public ministry.
Here He gives the reason: the bridegroom was still with the wedding
guests.
It was a season of feasting not fasting, of rejoicing not mourning.
A new day had dawned. The kingdom of God had drawn near. The
old order with its rites and ceremonies and legal bondage had gone
forever. Even when the Bridegroom was taken from them, there
would be no return to the legalism and asceticism of the old order.
Though His disciples would fast again, it would be for different
reasons and in a different spirit from that which characterized the
fasting of the Pharisees, or even of John the Baptist. As Jesus went
on to explain, the old Judaistic wineskin was not a suitable
receptacle for the new wine of the Spirit.
“The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from
them, and then they will fast.” This is perhaps the most crucial
statement in the New Testament on the question of fasting. To what
period of time was Jesus referring? Could He have meant the very
brief period following His arrest, until He reappeared in resurrection?
Some have thought so from His words, “A little while, and you will
see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me. . . . Truly,
truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will

---

rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy” (John
16:16, 20). The view has been expressed thus:
He was taken away from them, and they fasted and were sad
through those days of darkness; but He came back, and,
standing on the slope of Olivet, He said, “Lo, I am with you
alway.” Then there is no more room for mourning; no more
room for the sad face of agony; but there is room for mirth,
room for joy, and room for gladness.1
According to this view, the days of the absent Bridegroom were
limited to three or at the most four. With Christ’s resurrection and
reappearance, the period of fasting has passed away.
Very pleasant as it may be to hold this view, it would seem to be
untenable for several reasons. Firstly, this age is not one of
undiminished joy. Joy there certainly is, but it is not unmixed with
sadness. There is surely room for mourning while sin and sorrow
and conflict are all around us. “We must through many tribulations
enter the kingdom of God.”
Apart from all this, how could there be unclouded joy while our
beloved Lord and Master is still waiting to receive His kingdom, to
see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied? Surely His own words,
“Blessed are they that mourn,” must have application to this age.
Then again the Lord’s words stress only two periods of time.
There was the time of joy, “as long as the bridegroom is with them,”
which was then being fulfilled. There was the time of sorrow to
follow: “The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from
them.” But the above interpretation puts the emphasis on a third
phrase, when the Bridegroom came back to them, which is not in
view in this statement of Christ.
In our Lord’s analogy the guests at the wedding rejoice because
the bridegroom is with them. The festivities over, the bridegroom
departs, and the guests are sad because they do no know when they
will see him again. “The days will come, when the bridegroom is
taken away from them” suggests an absence of unspecified duration,
but surely longer than the brief spell of the festivities.
The time of joy and feasting clearly represents the years of His
earthly ministry. Is it likely that the time of mourning and fasting could
have been fulfilled in those few days of absence before He appeared

---

in resurrection? And, in any case, where is the evidence that they
fasted during those three days? When He appeared to them in the
upper room and asked them if they had anything to eat, they were
able to produce a piece of fish ready cooked (Luke 24:41–42).
We are therefore compelled to refer the days of His absence to
the period of this age, from the time He ascended to the Father until
He shall return from heaven. This is evidently how His apostles
understood Him, for it was not until after His ascension to the Father
that we read of them fasting (Acts 13:2–3).
Before the Bridegroom left them He promised that He would
come again to receive them unto Himself. The church still awaits the
midnight cry, “Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him” (Matt.
25:6). It is this age of the church that is the period of the absent
Bridegroom. It is this age of the church to which our Master referred
*when He said, “Then they will fast.” The time is now!*
These words of Jesus were prophetic. The first Christians fulfilled
them, and so have many saintly men and women of suceeding
generations. Where are those who fulfill them today? Alas, they are
few and far between, the exception rather than the rule, to the great
loss of the church.
A new generation, however, is arising. There is concern in the
hearts of many for the recovery of apostolic power. But how can we
recover apostolic power while neglecting apostolic practice? How
can we expect the power to flow if we do not prepare the channels?
Fasting is a God-appointed means for the flowing of His grace and
power that we can afford to neglect no longer.
The fast of this age is not merely an act of mourning for Christ’s
absence, but an act of preparation for His return. May those
prophetic words “Then will they fast” be finally fulfilled in this
generation. It will be a fasting and praying church that will hear the
thrilling cry, “Behold, the Bridegroom!” Tears shall then be wiped
*away, and the fast be followed by the feast at the marriage supper of*
the Lamb.
The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.”
“Surely I am coming soon.”
Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! (Rev. 22:17, 20)

### The Regular and Public Fasts

*On a fast day . . . you shall read the words of the Lord. Jeremiah 36:6*
*Sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly. Joel 2:15*
e have already noted that normally fasting is undertaken
occasionally, as the need arises, and that it is a personal
*matter between the individual and God. The regular and*
*public fasts, of which Scripture gives a number of examples, are*
obvious exceptions. There is a connection between these two in that
almost all the regular fasts of the Bible were also public ones, but not
all the public ones were necessarily regular.
The Day of Atonement, on which God had said that every
Israelite was to afflict himself (Lev. 23:27; see also Ps. 35:13 and
Isa. 58:5, KJV), was the only regular fast prescribed by the Mosaic
Law. From Acts 27:9 we learn that this fast was still observed by
Jews in New Testament times. In addition to “a fast day” in the time
of Jeremiah quoted above, we find in Zechariah 8:19 four regular
fasts commemorating the four main events connected with the
destruction of Jerusalem.1
By the time of Christ, the Pharisees had developed this practice
of regular fasting and had turned it, like every other spiritual thing
they touched, into a legal bondage. Thus, Christ presents us with a
picture of the typical Pharisee as a man who boasts in his prayer, “I
fast twice a week” (Luke 18:11–12). In the second and third centuries
after Christ, the Wednesday and Friday of each week became
recognized as fast days, and John Wesley revived this custom
among the early Methodists.
There is always the danger that any spiritual exercise that is done
habitually becomes an empty form, a ritual devoid of any spiritual
content. But we cannot reject the practice of regular fasting on
account of this danger. We do not abandon regular seasons of
prayer or the habit of giving regularly to God because the Pharisees
abused these also. Regular fasting need not become ritualistic, any
more than regular praying.
It needs to be stressed that fasting, whether regular or
occasional, is a matter between the individual and God. The lessons
of history would teach us to resist any tendency to allow regular

---

fasting by the individual to become a church custom. One short step
and the church custom has become a church rule to which the
faithful are obliged to bow, and another yoke has been placed upon
the neck of the disciples which neither the church fathers nor their
successors were able to bear. More will be said about this in the
chapter on asceticism.
Provided we watch these dangers and see to it that the habit
does not become a form devoid of spirit and life, and that we do not
try to force our personal exercise of heart upon others, there is real
value in the regular fast. Not only does it provide a regular
opportunity for spiritual examination and reorientation, but it is also a
valuable means of conserving that increasingly precious commodity
called “time.” A regular fast one day a week could mean that the time
spent over three meals, say two hours, is reclaimed from our busy
program and invested more specifically in the kingdom of God,
especially in the great ministry of prayer. Here is a weekly tonic for
both soul and body, which could also be an instrument for the
blessing of others.
Among those who permitted themselves to indulge in this luxury,
mention might be made of that patriarch of the Open Brethren,
Robert Chapman of Barnstaple (1803–1902). It was his custom to
spend every Saturday fasting. He did not see visitors on this day, but
shut himself up in his workshop, alone with God and with his lathe—
a time of recreation, communion, as well as preparation of his soul
for the coming Lord’s Day. It is recorded that someone who had to
make an emergency visit to the workshop one Saturday said, “His
face shone as the face of an angel.”2
Who can tell how much this practice contributed to the spiritual
stature that Robert Chapman attained and the rare intimacy of his
walk with God? Many would desire to attain to his sanctity of heart
and life without a willingness to tread the path he trod. “Why are we
not more holy?” asked John Wesley, another regular faster,
addressing his preachers. “Chiefly because we are enthusiasts,
looking for the end without the means.”
These regular fasts of the Old Testament were both national and
public. But there were also public fasts that were not regular, but
confined to times of special need and emergency. King Jehoshaphat

---

called the nation to fast when Judah was invaded (2 Chron. 20:1–4),
and Ezra likewise exhorted the returning exiles, before their perilous
journey back to Jerusalem with the precious things for the temple
(Ezra 8:21–23). Most spectacular of all was the public fast
undertaken by the city of Nineveh as a result of Jonah’s preaching,
which we shall consider in a later chapter.
These and other instances reveal that the public fast was called
for in times of national or spiritual crisis, in much the same way as in
the Second World War the King called the British to a day of prayer.
Two centuries earlier, the same nation was called to “a day of
solemn fasting and prayer” in view of a threatened invasion by the
French. On Friday, February 6, 1756, Wesley records in his journals:
The fast day was a glorious day, such as London has scarce
seen since the Restoration. Every church in the city was more
than full, and a solemn seriousness sat on every face. Surely
God heareth prayer, and there will yet be a lengthening of our
tranquillity.
A footnote informs us:
Humility was turned into national rejoicing for the threatened
invasion by the French was averted.
Wherever in Scripture we read of a public emergency being met
by a national call to fast, we find without exception that God
responded in deliverance. As grave national and international crises
undoubtedly lie ahead, it would be well for us to remember this
ancient biblical practice of sanctifying a public fast. Even if only the
godly within the nation are ready to respond, they will find that God’s
promise holds good: “I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their
sin and heal their land” (2 Chron. 7:14).
If there is a local church threatened with discord and division, if
spiritual life is waning and worldliness abounding, if conversions are
few and backslidings frequent, would not this be a time when leaders
should call that church to prayer and fasting?
Before leaving this section we should observe that fasting may
also refer in Scripture to abstaining from food involuntarily. The two
kinds of involuntary fasting are where there is no desire for food
because of anxiety, sorrow or mental distress (Dan. 6:18), and where

---

persons find themselves in a situation where no food is available
(Matt. 15:32).
Paul evidently knew a good deal of this latter sort. Some
commentators take his mention of “fastings” in Second Corinthians
6:5 and 11:27 to refer to this kind of involuntary hardship, as the RSV
rendering here confirms. Evidently Paul had no difficulty in
reconciling such experiences of want with the promise, “My God will
supply every need of yours.” He knew that the experience of finding
himself temporarily without food, and without the means to obtain it,
was a necessary trial of faith permitted by God for his ultimate
blessing. In the very context of the wonderful promise, he says: “I
have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content. I know how to be
abased, and I know how to abound; in any and all circumstances I
have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and
want” (Phil. 4:11–12).
If God should even call us to walk for a moment “the path of
necessity,” and we find ourselves on a fast that is not our choosing,
let us not fear. He will yet turn our captivity and bless our latter end
more than our beginning.
Tenth month, beginning of the siege (2 Kings 25:1). Fourth month,
fall of the city (Jer. 39:2). Fifth month, destruction of city and temple
(2 Kings 25:8–9). Seventh month, murder of Gedaliah (2 Kings
25:25).

### Fasting unto God

*When ye fasted . . . did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?*
Zechariah 7:5
*They ministered to the Lord, and fasted. Acts 13:2*
asting today! Whatever is to be gained by that?” is the
incredulous question of many Christians. If they mean, “What
does one personally gain by fasting?” then there are many
answers that may be given, and will be given in this book, but there
is a more important question to answer first.
So much of our thinking is ruled by that self-centered principle,
“What do I get out of it?” Even in our spiritual desires and
aspirations, self may still be enthroned. The cross must work in us if
the life is to be centered in God. Only so can our spiritual motivation
be radically altered and become Christward instead of self-ward. “He
died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto
themselves, but unto him” (2 Cor. 5:15, RV).
Even in circles where fasting is accepted as a normal spiritual
exercise, there is often so much emphasis on fasting for personal
benefit, for the enduement of power, for spiritual gifts, for physical
healing, for specific answers to prayer, that the other aspect is
forgotten. There is no suggestion that it is not right to seek these
things, but our underlying motives must first be right. It is deeply
significant that in the first statement on the subject of fasting in the
New Testament, Jesus dealt with the question of motive (Matt. 6:16–
18). No aspect of the subject is more important than this.
God is not merely concerned with what we do but why we do it. A
right act may be robbed of all its value in the sight of God if it is done
with a wrong motive. The danger of this is acute in the realm of
outward religious exercises. “Why have we fasted, and thou seest it
not?” asked the perplexed religionists of Isaiah’s day. Swift was
heaven’s answer, “Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own
pleasure” (Isa. 58:3). The fasts they undertook, with all their show of
piety, were motivated by self-interest and self-seeking. No wonder
God asked indignantly, “Is such the fast that I choose?” (58:5).
This same self-centerness under a cloak of piety was seen in all
its shameful hypocrisy in the fasting of the Pharisees, and it was

---

against this that Jesus lifted up His voice in the Sermon on the
Mount, telling His followers that when they fasted they were not to be
like the hypocrites. The Pharisees paraded their piety for the
applause of men by making sure that people knew they were fasting.
They were not ministering to God but to the pride of their own hearts.
Later, when Jesus described the Pharisee praying in the temple and
saying, “God, I thank thee that I am not like other men. . . . I fast
twice a week,” He is careful to inform us that he “prayed thus with
himself” (Luke 18:11–12).
Fasting must be done unto God, even before the eye of the
Father who sees in secret. While avoiding the brazen conceit of the
Pharisee and the desire to court the praise of man, we may still act
out of selfish motives, for the gratification of personal desires and
ambitions, and without the basic motive being the glory of God.
In Isaiah 58, the classic of Scripture on the subject of fasting,
*God reminds His people that the acceptable fast is the one which He*
has chosen. Fasting, like prayer, must be God-initiated and God-
ordained if it is to be effective. Prevailing prayer begins with God; He
places upon us a burden by the Spirit, and we respond to that
burden. Prayer that originates with God always returns to God. So it
is with fasting. When God chooses our fast, He will not have to ask
us, as He asked His people long ago, “When ye fasted . . . did ye at
all fast unto me, even to me?” (Zech. 7:5, RV).
All this does not of course relieve us of our responsibility. On our
part there must be the recognition of the rightness and need of
fasting, the willingness for the self-discipline involved, and the
exercise of heart before God; but in the final analysis the initiative is
His. When we fast, how long we fast, the nature of the fast and the
spiritual objectives we have before us are all God’s choice, to which
the obedient disciple gladly responds.
*This principle applies even to the regular fast, say one day a*
week. We must be sure that God is leading us to do this. Even then
there may be times when it will be inconvenient to carry it out, or
when we are guided not to do so; or a time may come when we are
led to discontinue the practice. We are not to be in bondage to rules,
even spiritual ones. “If you are led by the Spirit you are not under the
law” (Gal. 5:18). When Joel cried, “Sanctify a fast,” he meant “Set it

---

apart for God.” This is absolutely basic if our fasting is to be
acceptable to Him. Then there will be times when we shall forget the
matter of our personal gain, when we shall be caught up in wonder,
love and praise, as we fast unto God. We shall find ourselves like
Anna the prophetess, “worshipping with fasting” (Luke 2:37), or like
those leaders of the church in Antioch who “ministered to the Lord,
and fasted” (Acts 13:2, KJV; “worshipping the Lord,” RSV). This is
surely the loftiest conception, that it is a worshipping or ministering to
the Lord, a giving of ourselves to God, and only secondarily a means
to secure certain spiritual ends.
We cannot do better than to quote in conclusion from John
Wesley’s famous sermon on fasting:
First, let it be done unto the Lord, with our eye singly fixed on
Him. Let our intention herein be this, and this alone, to glorify
our Father which is in heaven; to express our sorrow and
shame for our manifold transgressions of His holy law; to wait
for an increase of purifying grace, drawing our affections to
things above; to add seriousness and to obtain all the great
and precious promises which He hath made to us in Jesus
*Christ. . . . Let us beware of fancying we merit anything of*
God by our fasting. We cannot be too often warned of this;
inasmuch as a desire to “establish our own righteousness,” to
procure salvation of debt and not of grace, is so deeply rooted
in all our hearts. Fasting is only a way which God hath
ordained, wherein we wait for His unmerited mercy; and
wherein, without any desert of ours, He hath promised freely
to give us His blessing.1
God’s chosen fast, then, is that which He has appointed; that
which is set apart for Him, to minister to Him, to honor and glorify
Him; that which is designed to accomplish His sovereign will. Then
we shall find, as though it were heaven’s afterthought, that the fast
unto God rebounds in blessing on our heads, and the God who sees
in secret is graciously pleased to reward us openly. In this way we
are preserved from ever permitting the blessings to mean more to us
than the Blesser, “For from Him and through Him and to Him are all
things. To Him be glory for ever. Amen” (Rom. 11:36).

### For Personal Sanctity

*I humbled my soul with fasting. Psalm 69:10*
*Blessed are those who mourn. Matthew 5:4*
e have now seen what fasting is. We have established that it
is a biblical practice, and that it is for today. We have
distinguished various types of fasts and seen how essential it
is that our motives are right: that we fast unto God. Now we come to
examine in Scripture the purposes of fasting. Here, then, is the first
answer to the question, “What is the good of it?” It is a valuable aid
to personal sanctity.
If humility is the basic ingredient of true holiness, the soil in which
the graces flourish, is it not needful that from time to time we should,
like David, humble our souls with fasting? Behind many of our
besetting sins and personal failures, behind the many ills that infect
our church fellowships and clog the channels of Christian service—
the clash of personalities and temperaments, the strife and division
—lies that insidious pride of the human heart.
How is it that fasting can help us here? On the negative side
pride and a too-full stomach are old bedfellows. What was the sin of
Sodom? Not primarily that gross form of immorality known anciently
as sodomy, now called homosexuality. The Bible says, “This was the
guilt of your sister Sodom, pride, surfeit of food, and prosperous
ease” (Ezek. 16:49).
When we look at the nations of the West today where this sin of
Sodom is rampant, we can discern the same root causes. History
cannot help repeating itself. Given the same conditions, the same
malaise inevitably follows.
God foresaw that pride and full feeding would be one of Israel’s
pitfalls when they entered the land of promise. “God has led you
these forty years in the wilderness,” Moses reminded them. “He
humbled you and let you hunger.” (Deut. 8:2–3). Now those days of
discipline were over, and the land of plenty that they were about to
possess would provide new temptations, so Moses went on to warn
them, “Take heed . . . lest, when you have eaten and are full . . . your
heart be lifted up” (8:11–14). Hosea tells us that this is exactly what
happened (Hos. 13:6), despite the warning.

---

Fasting, then, is a divine corrective to the pride of the human
heart. It is a discipline of the body with a tendency to humble the
soul. “I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might
humble ourselves before our God,” records Ezra (8:21; see also Isa.
58:3).
If, then, to the devout Israelite fasting meant humbling, it also
meant mourning. In fact, in Old Testament days it was practiced as a
sign of mourning for the departed, almost as a part of the funeral
rites (1 Sam. 31:13, etc.). It is associated with the rending of the
garment and the wearing of sackcloth and ashes (Ezra 9:5, etc.). In
Matthew 9:15 we have seen how our Lord treated “mourn” and “fast”
as interchangeable terms.
There is a natural sequence as we move from self-humbling to
the mourning of repentance and contrition. Israel fasted in
repentance in the days of Samuel, and so did the returned exiles in
the time of Nehemiah (1 Sam. 7:6; Neh. 9:1–2). Mourning over
personal sin and failure is an indispensable stage in the process of
sanctification, and it is facilitated by fasting.
However, God wants to bring us beyond the place of mourning
only for our personal sins, to where we are moved by the Spirit to
mourn for the sins of the church, the nation, and even the world. It is
of the deepest concern to God to find those who share His feelings
for the spiritual situation that exists on every hand.
Ezekiel was given a vision of the judgment of God coming upon
Jerusalem because of its abominations. Before the heavenly
executioners were permitted to destroy the inhabitants of the city, a
man was sent before them to “put a mark upon the foreheads of the
men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are
committed in it.” The executioners were then commanded to go forth
and slay without mercy all except those who had the mark, and to
begin at God’s sanctuary (Ezek. 9:4–6).
Heaven marks the men who feel with God for the sins that break
His heart and turn away His face from us. The same abominations
are still being committed in sanctuary and in city. If today God put a
mark on those who sigh and groan because of this, and then sent
forth His executioners to destroy all but those with the mark, would
we escape?

---

Will such mourning accomplish anything? Indeed, it may be just
as remedial in the corporate sphere as in the personal. True, in
Ezekiel’s vision the sin of the people had reached the point of “no
return,” and judgment had become inevitable, but this is by no
means always the case. There is always the hope that spiritual
forces will be released which will work toward repentance and
recovery.
The eyes of the Lord are still searching the earth today for the
Ezras who will confess the sins of a faithless remnant, weeping and
casting themselves down before the Lord; or the Nehemiahs who will
weep and mourn, fast and pray for the walls that are broken down,
and the gates that are destroyed by fire. If restoration and renewal
are to come from the presence of the Lord—and what hope is there
without them?—then it is men and women like these whom God will
use to turn the tide.
In the fasting for personal sanctity, we must also include the
*positive aspect of consecration to God. Perhaps the best example of*
this is the forty day fast undertaken by our Lord prior to His public
ministry. His baptism in the Jordan was His dedication unto death in
anticipation of the cross. Though He received the Spirit then in
measureless fullness, the power was not operative until He returned
from the wilderness testing. By His acceptance of those six weeks of
fasting, He was reaffirming His determination to do the will of His
Father even to the end. It was His final preparation and consecration
for His heavenly mission. As He returned to Galilee in the power of
the Spirit, the works of God were manifested in Him.
Something of this is seen in the setting apart of Barnabas and
Paul for their apostolic ministry. “Then after fasting and praying they
laid their hands on them and sent them off” (Acts 13:3). Not a social
tea but a consecration fast marked the first missionary valedictory.
Later we see these men appointing elders in every church, with
prayer and fasting (Acts 14:23). Thus were the local leaders
consecrated to their holy office. Where are the churches today where
the leaders are set apart in a solemn season of prayer and fasting?
Perhaps here is one reason why office in the church is so often
lightly taken up, loosely held and readily tossed aside when

---

difficulties or differences emerge. Little wonder we lack strong
spiritual leadership, and the sheep tend to drift.
If you have been brought low through personal defeat; if there is
a call in your soul to a deeper purifying, to a renewed consecration; if
there is the challenge of some new task for which you feel ill-
equipped—then it is time to inquire of God whether He would not
have you separate yourself unto Him in fasting.

### To Be Heard On High

*So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he listened to our*
*entreaty. Ezra 8:23*
saiah lived in a day when formalism and hypocrisy had rendered
the religious exercise of fasting obnoxious to God. But we need to
remember that this was also true of their offerings, their prayers
and their worship (Isa. 1:10–15). In that remarkable chapter on
fasting, the 58th of Isaiah, God not only uncovered the self-seeking
and self-pleasing which lay behind this show of piety, but He went on
*to unfold the character of the fast that He had chosen, and the*
blessing that it could bring to others as well as themselves.
Fasting is here connected with seeking God, drawing near to
God, prevailing with God. These ends, however, were not being
realized, because their motive in fasting was not a right one. God
had to say: “Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be
heard on high” (58:4). But that is clearly one thing that fasting is
intended to do, for, describing the fast that He has chosen, God goes
on to say, “Then you shall call and the Lord will answer” (58:9).
Fasting is designed to make prayer mount up as on eagles’
wings. It is intended to usher the suppliant into the audience
chamber of the King and to extend to him the golden sceptre. It may
be expected to drive back the oppressing powers of darkness and
loosen their hold on the prayer objective. It is calculated to give an
edge to a man’s intercessions and power to his petitions. Heaven is
ready to bend its ear to listen when someone prays with fasting.
How often we have made earnest prayer to God for some
specific need, with the assurance that this was in the will of God, and
yet there has been no answer from heaven. Why? It could well be,
*and often is, that God is saying to us, “When you seek me with all*
*your heart, I will be found by you” (Jer. 29:13–14). When a man is*
willing to set aside the legitimate appetites of the body to concentrate
on the work of praying, he is demonstrating that he means business,
that he is seeking with all his heart, and will not let God go unless He
answers.
This
thought
of
fasting
as
being
an
expression
of
wholeheartedness is clear from Joel’s call to the nation:

---

“Yet even now,” says the Lord, “return to me with all your
heart, with fasting.” (Joel 2:12)
Says Andrew Murray:
Fasting helps to express, to deepen, and to confirm the
resolution that we are ready to sacrifice anything, to sacrifice
ourselves to attain what we seek for the kingdom of God.1
Closely related to this is the idea of fasting as giving power to a
demand, of bringing pressure to bear in support of one’s request.
There was an ancient Irish custom of “fasting against or upon a
person,” which meant “to sit without food or drink at the door of a
debtor, or any person who refused to satisfy a lawful demand.”2
Outside the spiritual realm this is seen in fasts that have been
undertaken by politicians, prisoners, or others, to bring pressure to
bear on authorities and to obtain desired ends.
Without doubt this is an important aspect of the fasting prayer. Of
course, we must not think of fasting as a hunger strike designed to
force God’s hand and get our own way! Prayer, however, is much
more complex than simply asking a loving father to supply his child’s
need. Prayer is warfare! Prayer is wrestling! There are opposing
forces. There are spiritual crosscurrents. When we plead our case in
the court of heaven, when we cry to the Judge of all the earth,
“Vindicate me against my adversary” (Luke 18:3), that adversary is
also represented in court (Job 1:6, 2:1 ; Zech. 3:1). It is not enough
that the Judge is willing; there is the opposition that must first be
overcome.
This is a realm of deep mystery. Scripture states the facts but
does not explain them. Importunity is needful in the spiritual realm.
Often pressure has to be maintained before the breakthrough comes
in the heavenly warfare. There are situations that call for “men of
violence” who take the kingdom by force (Matt. 11:12). And all this is
no reflection on the willingness of the Most High to fulfill the desires
of those who fear Him. Fasting is calculated to bring a note of
urgency and importunity into our praying, and to give force to our
pleading in the court of heaven.
The man who prays with fasting is giving heaven notice that he is
truly in earnest; that he will not give up nor let God go without the
blessing; that he does not intend to take “no” for an answer. Not only

---

so, but he is expressing his earnestness in a divinely appointed way.
He is using a means that God has chosen to make his voice to be
heard on high.
Fasting was sometimes the climax of earnest and prolonged
supplication. When the heavens remained as brass despite earnest
and persistent prayer, men were sometimes driven in their
desperation to fasting as the only solution. The Benjamites
committed a terrible crime, and God told the other tribes to go up
against them. They did, and were twice heavily defeated, though
they prayed and wept before the Lord. The third time they fasted as
well as wept before the Lord, and God gave them overwhelming
victory (Judg. 20). What power with God to turn the tide has prayer
accompanied by fasting!
Again and again the Israelites fasted in times of national
emergency, and what appeared to be certain disaster was averted.
And are there no occasions today when death or danger threaten us,
that we so seldom employ this means of grace? When Ezra was
carrying a large consignment of gold and silver to the temple in
Jerusalem along a route infested with bandits, he records, “I
proclaimed a fast . . . that we might humble ourselves before our
God, to seek from him a straight way for ourselves, our children, and
all our goods” (Ezra 8:21, 23, 31). How wonderfully God answered!
Do we never face crucial situations calling for divine guidance or
protection, that require us to do as Ezra did?
Daniel sought God with fasting for the fulfillment of the promise of
the restoration of Jerusalem (Jer. 29:10–13) and received through
the angel Gabriel a wonderful unfolding of God’s plan for Israel (Dan.
9). If we have sought God in vain for the fulfillment of some promise,
it could be that He is waiting for us to humble ourselves and seek
Him as Daniel did.
Saul of Tarsus, following his conversion on the road to
Damascus, and still blinded by the glory of that light, had been
fasting for three days without food or water. His heart was being
prepared for further blessing God had for him. Then a disciple called
Ananias was sent to lay hands on him that his sight might be
restored, and that he might be filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:10–
18). Is it some healing touch that we have looked for in vain, despite

---

the assurance of His promise? Or are we still seeking the filling with
the Spirit and wondering why our prayers are not heard? We think
we are waiting for heaven, but heaven is waiting for us. When
heaven can point out the fasting suppliant, and declare, “Behold, he
is praying,” the answer will surely be at the doors.
In giving us the privilege of fasting as well as praying, God has
added a powerful weapon to our spiritual armory. In her folly and
ignorance, the church has largely looked upon it as obsolete. She
has thrown it down in some dark corner to rust, and there it has lain

### To Change God’s Mind

*The people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast. . . . When*
*God saw what they did . . . God repented of the evil which he had said he*
*would do to them. Jonah 3:5, 10*
he power to prevail with God was never more clearly
demonstrated in Bible times than when a pronouncement of
divine judgment was averted or deferred through prayer and
fasting. “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” cried the
Hebrew prophet. The king of Nineveh proclaimed an absolute fast for
man and beast, while the people cried mightily to God and turned
from their evil way. “Who knows,” ran the royal proclamation, “God
may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger, so that we perish not.”
Nor were they disappointed in this hope, for “God repented of the
evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did not do it.”
The Ninevites’ repentance, expressed in prayer and fasting,
moved God to change the decree of judgment He had pronounced
against them. This action on the part of God presents us with a
theological poser. God is revealed as omniscient, as One who sees
the end from the beginning. His foreknowledge is complete and
infallible. His character and counsels are immutable. “I the Lord do
not change” (Mal. 3:6). All Scripture affirms that these are the
attributes of the Almighty, and our common sense tells us that
without them God would not be God.
Why, then, do so many Old Testament Scriptures affirm that “the
Lord repented” or changed His mind? God certainly foreknew, when
He sent Jonah, that Nineveh would repent and that its destruction
would be averted. This was God’s purpose in sending him, that He
might extend mercy toward this people. Jonah’s message of
impending judgment was therefore conditional, though this was not
clearly revealed to Jonah or declared to the Ninevites.
God has inflexible laws in dealing with men. Sin is visited with
judgment, but repentance with mercy. God has declared Himself on
this point in the plainest of terms:
“If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that
I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that

---

*nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I*
*will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it” (Jer. 18:7–8).*
This repentance of God, therefore, does not imply any caprice on
His part, but is wholly in keeping with His intentions declared
beforehand. Because man repents in respect to sin, God repents in
respect to judgment. Strictly speaking, then, it is not God that really
changes, but man. Man’s change of heart makes it morally possible
for God to behave differently toward him, yet acting consistently with
His holy character and principles.
Why, then, does Scripture say that God repented, or changed His
mind? This is an example of a common figure of speech1 in the
Hebrew Scriptures by which God’s person or action is viewed from
the human standpoint. We may think of this as the Holy Spirit’s use
of language which is an accomodation to our finite understanding.
So far as His declared intentions are concerned, we may say that
God repented, for these were conditional; but as far as His character
and principles are concerned, “God is not man . . . that he should
repent” (Num. 23:19).
After the murder of Naboth and Ahab’s compulsory acquisition of
his vineyard, God sent Elijah to pronounce divine judgment upon
him. “When Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put
sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted.” God then declared, “Because
he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring evil in his days;
but in his son’s days” (1 Kings 21:27–29). Judgment was deferred
because even such a man as Ahab was prepared to humble his soul
with fasting. How great is God’s mercy! How great the power of
fasting to call it forth!
David had evidently grasped this fact concerning prayer and
fasting. Because of his grievous sin in the matter of Uriah, God had
said that his baby son, born of Bathsheba, would die. When the child
sickened, David knew that if there was anything that could alter the
decree of judgment it was prayer and fasting. “David therefore
besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all
night upon the ground.” After the death of the baby, David explained:
“While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said,
‘Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the
child may live?’” (2 Sam. 12:16, 22)

---

Among the nations of the West, we are witnessing a rising tide of
godlessness and lawlessness, similar to that which culminated in the
wiping out of civilization by the flood. The sins which brought fire and
brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah are fast
becoming socially acceptable. Those who should be preachers of
righteousness and upholders of the law of God speak out in defence
of “the new morality.” Surely the writing is upon the wall. The
overtones of coming judgment are clear enough to those who have
ears to hear.
Even if heaven has issued the decree and the wheels are already
in motion, there is still a mighty weapon to which we may have
recourse.
“Yet even now,” says the Lord, “return to me with your heart,
with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your
hearts and not your garments.”
And then the prophet adds, as though by way of explanation:
“Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a
blessing behind him?” (Joel 2:12–14)
It seems clear from the prophetic Scriptures that ultimately
judgment must fall upon the Christ-rejecting nations. Even Nineveh
was ultimately overthrown. But if God can find those who will stand
in the gap, even in this eleventh hour, and humble themselves with
prayer and fasting, there may yet be a lengthening of our tranquility.
God may yet turn and repent and leave a blessing behind Him,
giving us mercy instead of wrath, and revival instead of judgment.
Such a deferring of the evil day could mean the salvation of
multitudes, but there is no time to be lost.
An anthropopathism, which ascribes to God the feelings of man.

### To Free the Captives

*Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to*
*undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break*
*every yoke? Isaiah 58:6*
n the day of your fast you . . . oppress all your workers” (or “exact
all your labours,” KJV), God declared through Isaiah (58:3). Years
later Christ said of the scribes and Pharisees, “They bind heavy
burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders” (Matt.
23:4), and this despite the fact that they were punctilious in the
observance of their weekly fasts.
In this wonderful verse which is the theme of our chapter, God
reveals through Isaiah that the nature of the fast that He has chosen
is the very opposite. It is not to bring men into bondage but to loose
them from it; not to be an instrument of oppression but of liberation.
If this word does not have a literal application for us who live in lands
where there is little to be seen of the grosser forms of social
injustice, it surely has an application in the spiritual realm. Men are
bound, not with steel chains or iron fetters, but with the invisible
shackles of evil. They fight oppression which is not social but
spiritual, even satanic.
In these days when the Spirit of God is moving and the power of
God is being released, evil forces that have lain dormant in human
breasts for years are being compelled to throw off their camouflage
and manifest themselves for what they are. The discerning eye can
recognize that many whom we meet in the path of life are oppressed
by the devil, vexed by demons, bound by forces that they do not
understand and from which they cannot break free. In many cases
they loathe themselves for their actions, weep with sheer frustration
at their own impotence to break the chains, and pray as best they
know how for deliverance.
An increasingly large proportion of the younger generation are
hopelessly bound by nicotine, alcohol, drugs, sex desire and the
gambling fever. Others are deceived and entangled by satanically
inspired cults and societies, and by varous forms of black magic,
witchcraft and spiritism. Worse still, there are Christians bound by
fear, resentment, jealousy and uncleanness, who know full well that

---

they are in themselves a complete contradiction to the liberating
gospel they profess—but how to get free? They try hard to pray, to
believe, to claim, yet still they are bound.
“Are you suggesting,” someone may say, “that the gospel we
preach is not enough for the needs of such?” The gospel is indeed
enough, but not necessarily “the gospel we preach”; for more often
than not we preach a deficient gospel. Forgiveness through the
death of Christ, though vital, is not the whole gospel. Often a man in
the grip of Satan is incapable of responding to this message. Or if he
does respond, he may have his sins forgiven without his shackles
being loosed. He is saved without being delivered.
Simon of Samaria wished to procure with money the power to lay
hands on people for the impartation of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:9–24).
Just because Simon’s case presents difficulties, we should not try to
escape from them by the simple device of asserting that he was
never truly born again. The facts are all against this, and it obscures
the lesson that the incident is designed to teach. The Holy Spirit tells
us that he “believed,” was “baptized,” and “continued with Philip”
(Acts 8:13). Here are the same credentials of conversion—faith,
baptism and continuance—which marked those first converts on the
day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41–42).
When Peter told Simon, “You have neither part nor lot in this
matter,” he was not referring to his salvation, nor even to the
reception of the gift of the Holy Spirit, but to the power to lay hands
on believers for the impartation of the Holy Spirit. It was “in this
matter” of the gift he desired, the motive for desiring it, and the
means by which he sought to acquire it, that his heart was not right
before God. Peter did not exhort him to repent of his sins in general,
but “of this wickedness of yours.”
How did Simon come to be in this “bond of iniquity”? Before his
conversion he had a mania for greatness, and through black magic
had leagued himself with the powers of darkness to accomplish his
ends. No man who has dabbled in spiritism, witchcraft, clairvoyance,
palmistry, fortune-telling, and such like, can hope to extricate himself
easily from the clutches of Satan. Thus, with Simon there was this
“carry-over” from his past life from which he needed to be loosed.
How many professing Christians today are like him?

---

Forgiveness was only one facet of Christ’s message. Here, in His
own words, were His terms of reference: “He has anointed me to
preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release
to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty
those who are oppressed” (Luke 4:18). Those words were uttered at
the commencement of His ministry. After it was over, Peter described
to the Roman centurion “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and
healing all that were oppressed by the devil” (Acts 10:38).
When our Lord came face to face with a demon-possessed man
longing for deliverance, He did not say, “Your sins be forgiven you.”
He cast out the demons with a word. When He met a woman in the
synagogue who had been bound by Satan for eighteen years and
could not straighten her body, He did not say, “Your faith has saved
you, go in peace.” He laid His hands on her and said, “Woman, you
are freed from your infirmity” (Luke 13:12). Today we send the man
to the psychiatrist and the woman to the physiotherapist! When the
root of their trouble is satanic, how can they be cured by the
treatment of mental or physical symptoms?
Christ commissioned His disciples not only to preach the good
news, but to heal the sick and to cast out demons (Luke 9:1–2). The
seventy reported, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name!” (Luke 10:17). In this highly educated and sophisticated age,
we have discarded such old-fashioned notions. In worldly society the
devil has been laughed out of court. Among professing Christians
demon possession is looked upon as peculiar to Bible times or
primitive societies or, at most, extremely rare in our modern society.
The devil rubs his hands with glee at our blindness.
How great is the need today for the gift of discerning these spirits,
and for the faith and authority to cast them out. Undoubtedly many
today languishing in mental institutions need, not drugs or electro-
shock treatment, but deliverance in the all-prevailing Name. Many in
our churches, cruelly oppressed and tormented by the devil, need to
be ministered to by those who know how to set the captives free.
Many outside the churches, in the highways and byways of life,
driven by the devil, are waiting for those who will come to them with
a message and ministry of deliverance.

---

What of the many today who have fallen among thieves? Are we
to leave them in the gutter to welter in their blood? Are we simply to
pass them by on the other side? It is certain we need to seek and
obtain the heavenly anointing for such a ministry. The servant is not
greater than his Master, that he can afford to be without his Master’s
equipping. We need to be equipped with the gifts of the Holy Spirit to
discern and deliver. But this is not all. Fasting is a powerful auxiliary
weapon, appointed by God, to break the enemy’s hold.
“Is not this the fast that I choose,” says the Lord: “to loose the
bonds . . . to undo the thongs . . . to let the oppressed go free, and to
break every yoke?” The primary reference is, of course, to literal
slavery. But for us there is a spiritual application, and we must
recognize the vital part that fasting has to play in this ministry of
deliverance. This is warfare in the realm of “principalities and
powers.” Satan is a stubborn foe, and will not relinquish his grasp on
the spirits and souls, minds and bodies of men unless compelled to
do so. Fasting seems to provide that compelling.
In setting free one who is in Satan’s power, a “softening-up”
process by prayer is often necessary. A fast undertaken at God’s
direction will strengthen the intercessor to maintain pressure until the
Enemy is compelled to loosen his grasp on the captive. Then fasting
will also give authority, when God’s moment comes, to speak the
commanding word that effects the release. This is one of the open
secrets behind a ministry of deliverance from the power of Satan, as
we shall now illustrate.

### They Fasted to Deliver

*Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be*
*rescued? Surely, thus says the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty*
*shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued, for I will contend*
*with those who contend with you. Isaiah 49:24–25*
astor Hsi was surely one of the greatest saints that the land of
China has produced. Dr. D. M. Lloyd-Jones, in the Foreword to
the one-volume edition of his life, says:
He was truly a man of God in the real sense of the word. His
simple childlike faith, which yet was strong and unshakeable,
was astonishing. He took the New Testament as it was and
put it into practice without any hesitations or reservations.1
Delivered at the time of his conversion from the awful tyranny of
opium smoking, God used this man in a ministry which brought
deliverance to hundreds of his fellow countrymen from opium and
demon possession. Many were healed through the laying on of
hands. The hearts of multitudes were thus opened to the gospel, and
churches sprang up throughout the region. From the time of his
*conversion, he took the name of Sheng-mo, meaning “conqueror of*
demons,” as if by some strange intuition he knew the work that God
had raised him up to do.
Within a few months of his own deliverance came the first great
test. His wife, who had given evidence of being influenced by his
new-found faith, became demon possessed. She suffered from deep
depression and mental torment, and when the time came for daily
worship, she was seized with “paroxysms of ungovernable rage.”
The villagers to a man believed that her possession by evil spirits
was a judgment upon Hsi for his sin against the gods. “A famous
conqueror of demons!” they cried. “Let us see what his faith can do
now!”
Hsi had already learned the power of prayer coupled with fasting
in the conflict with Satan:
He called for a fast of three days and nights in his household,
and gave himself to prayer. Weak in body, but strong in faith,
he laid hold on the promises of God, and claimed complete
deliverance. Then without hesitation he went to his distressed

---

wife, and laying his hands upon her, in the name of Jesus
commanded the evil spirits to depart and torment her no
more.
Mrs. Hsi was delivered instantly and permanently, and forthwith
declared herself a Christian. She became his able and devoted
partner in the work of God.
Thus began a ministry which has been rightly described as
“apostolic.” It was characterized by tremendous conflict with the
powers of darkness. Great was the power of Satan let loose against
him, but greater was the power of God with him to save, deliver and
heal. Whatever the crisis that arose—the need of guidance in some
important decision, wisdom in handling difficult people or difficult
situations, the deliverance of opium addicts or those possessed by
demons, the withstanding of persecution or opposition—Hsi had only
one remedy. He gave himself to prayer and fasting. What mighty
victories and deliverances God wrought for him and through him!
While Hsi was still a Confucian scholar and bound hopelessly by the
opium habit, God raised up a deliverer in Germany, another
“apostolic man” who was similarly used to set many free from evil
spirits. Andrew Murray writes of this minister thus:
At the time when Blumhardt was passing through his terrible
conflict with evil spirits in those possessed, and seeking to
cast them out by prayer, he often wondered what it was that
hindered the answer. One day a friend, to whom he had
spoken of his trouble, directed his attention to our Lord’s
words about fasting. Blumhardt resolved to give himself to
fasting, sometimes for more than thirty hours.
The effect of this divinely appointed exercise is told in his own words:
Inasmuch as the fasting is before God, a practical proof that
the thing we ask is to us a matter of true and pressing
interest, and inasmuch as in a high degree it strengthens the
intensity and power of prayer, and becomes the unceasing
practical expression of a prayer without words, I could believe
that it would not be without efficacy. I tried it, without telling
anyone, and in truth the later conflict was extraordinarily
lightened by it. I could speak with much greater restfulness
and decision. I did not require to be so long present with the

---

sick one; and I felt that I could influence without being
present.2
Thus, the ministry of the German pastor grew in power and
effectiveness as he fasted to deliver.
Are there those today being used of God in such a ministry? Yes
indeed, an increasing number. A woman of prayer in the north of
England and known personally to the writer, records the following:
I received a letter from a lady whom I did not know, telling me
about her daughter who was ill. I invited her to my home, and
she recounted how this daughter, now thirty-seven, had made
a profession of faith when quite young and had been baptized
at fourteen. She took up nursing and went quite wrong. She
had a baby, and this tragedy seemed to restore her to the
Lord for a time. Then she turned away again saying, “God has
done nothing for me; I will see what the devil will do.”
She was in a mental hospital, and when her parents
visited her she threw grapes at them. She would call her
father “Hitler,” and her mother “Queen Mary.” Then she would
lie back on the pillow and say, “Evil spirits! Evil spirits!”
My heart went out to the weeping mother, and I promised
to fast and pray for her daughter. On the third day of my fast I
felt an urge to cast out the demon from this girl in the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ. I received a letter from the mother
telling me that my prayers had been answered. Her daughter
had been found unconscious on the bathroom floor. When
she came round she was healed, although very weak, and
was soon after sent home.
There are many such needy cases around us. Are we afraid to
face them because we know our impotence and fear the power of
the devil? Most of us are honest enough to admit that faced with
such cases we would not know what to do. We would prefer to call in
the psychiatrist rather than tackle a problem for which we know
ourselves to be ill-equipped. At least our escapism avoids the
embarrassment and humiliation of failure, of having to inquire of the
Lord, “Why could not we cast it out?” But are we really satisfied with
this situation? Or what is even more pertinent, is He satisfied?

---

The Lord surely wants us to know His own deep compassion for
these tormented souls. He has given us the authority to deliver them.
“In my name they will cast out demons” (Mark 16:17). Do we care
enough to fast and pray for their deliverance?
It is true that deliverance is seldom possible unless those
possessed or bound are wholly desirous of it, and ready by
repentance and confession of any sin which has opened the door to
Satan to deprive him of any rights within them. Especially is this true
in the case of professed believers. But so often there is this deep
desire on the part of those afflicted, but no one to whom they can
turn who will use the God-given authority, pay the price if need be in
prayer and fasting and command the deliverance.

### For Revelation

*I, Daniel . . . turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and*
*supplications with fasting. . . . Gabriel . . . said to me, O Daniel, I have*
*now come out to give you wisdom and understanding. Daniel 9:2 – 3, 21*
– 22
hough it is often assumed that visions, revelations and inspired
dreams passed away with Bible times, Scripture never asserted
that this would be the case, and church history supplies plenty
of evidence to the contrary. Such means may not be the normal ones
by which God imparts His truth or reveals His will, but neither were
they in Bible days. The fact remains that God may now, as much as
He did then, speak to men in unusual ways.
In times of revival, the church has witnessed in the outpouring of
the Spirit a fulfillment, however partial, of the Joel prophecy:
“Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your
young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream
dreams” (Acts 2:17, citing Joel 2:28).
A new breathing of the Spirit is being felt throughout the earth.
God is again demonstrating His readiness to manifest His presence
and communicate His mind in the very ways that Joel predicted.
Perhaps He has always been ready, but we have been unprepared.
Is there not here the danger of deception and delusion and even
fanaticism? Yes, but that danger has always been present, and it is
no greater now than in Bible times when God manifestly spoke in
such ways. As God was prepared to “take the risk” then, why should
He not do the same again? The devil was busy in Jeremiah’s day
counterfeiting the true work of the Spirit, for he speaks of those who
utter “a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own
minds” (Jer. 14:14; see also Ezek. 13:6–7).
The fact that there is forged currency being passed into
circulation only proves the existence of the genuine. Satan does not
waste his time counterfeiting what no longer exists. For every false
prophet like Zedekiah, God has His Micaiah (1 Kings 22). For every
Hananiah He has His Jeremiah (Jer. 28). To turn our backs on the
real because of fear of the counterfeit (an attitude all too prevalent
among evangelical believers today) is to set ourselves up as being

---

wiser than the Almighty, and thereby playing into the hands of the
devil. Fear is one of his most effective weapons against the true
work of the Spirit.
Having said all this, we still do well to proceed with caution. We
cannot afford to ignore the warnings of Scripture. Let us believe in
these things because the Word teaches them, but let us always test
them by the Word. From time to time, John Wesley saw the
supernatural at work in his ministry and acknowledged it as of God.
His warning is therefore all the more timely and acceptable:
Do not ascribe to God what is not of God. Do not easily
suppose dreams, voices, impressions, visions, revelations to
be from God without sufficient evidence. They may be purely
natural: they may be diabolical. Therefore remember the
caution of the apostle, “Beloved, believe not every spirit but
try the spirits whether they be of God.” Try all things by the
written Word and let all bow down before it.
Without doubt there is a very close connection between the
practice of fasting and the receiving of spiritual revelation. Many non-
Christian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism and
Islam practice fasting because they know its power to detach one’s
mind from the world of sense, and to sharpen one’s sensibility to the
world of spirit. The abstaining from foods is still an important tenet of
Spiritism, as it was in Paul’s day (1 Tim. 4:1–3).
In the first chapter of Daniel we are introduced to four young
Hebrews who refused to defile themselves with the king’s rich food
and with the wine which he drank, as these would have been first
offered to the heathen deities. Instead, they preferred “vegetables to
eat and water to drink.” The result was that “God gave them learning
and skill in all visions and dreams” (Dan. 1:12, 17). They proved to
be “ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were
in all his kingdom.” So Daniel, trained from youth to a life of discipline
in which fasting played a significant part (Dan. 9:2–3; 10:1–3),
became one of the greatest Old Testament seers of visions and
dreams.
The New Testament illustrates the same point. It was when Peter
“became hungry and desired something to eat” (Acts 10:10) that God
gave him the vision that led to the opening of the door of faith to the

---

Gentiles. Having told us that he was “in fastings often” (2 Cor. 11:27,
KJV), Paul proceeds to speak in the next chapter of his “visions and
revelations of the Lord.” The angelic message given to Paul at the
height of the Mediterranean storm came after a long period of
abstinence (Acts 27:21–24). Certainly the prisoner of Diocletian in
the solitude of Patmos would not have been living on the fat of the
land when he became “in the Spirit on the Lord’s day,” and was
given the final revelation of Jesus Christ.
We have not found anything in Scripture to suggest that we are to
*seek visions, dreams or supernatural revelations, but the point we*
are making is that those who give themselves to seeking God with
fasting may find God rewarding them with such manifestations of His
presence. But these do not constitute the only, or even the most
important, aspect of revelation.
Constantly we are needing revelation concerning the will of God
for our lives. We face situations that call for divine wisdom and
understanding. Pastor Hsi was faced with a serious crisis in the early
days of the opium refuge work when the supply of foreign medicines
failed. These were vital for the treatment of the patients. In this
desperate situation the thought came to him that maybe God would
use his knowledge of native drugs to compound a medicine to take
the place of the foreign supply. He sought the Lord with prayer and
fasting to show him the proper ingredients. Mrs. Howard Taylor then
records the sequel:
Very simply it all came to him just how those pills were to be
made. The drugs were at hand in his store and, still fasting,
he took the prescription, compounded the medicine and
hastened back to the Refuge. It proved an entire success and
entirely changed the aspect of the opium refuge work.’
Why is it that we do not apply this age-old prescription of prayer
and fasting to meet our desperate situations?
Finally, there is the question of revelation upon the written Word.
We all tend to be bound by traditional viewpoints. There is urgent
need for fresh light to break out from God’s holy Word on such
controversial subjects as the church, its nature and function; the
work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer; the prophetic
scriptures and God’s future program.

---

We may read and study, discuss and argue, champion this
viewpoint or that, but the need of these challenging days is for that
“spirit of wisdom and revelation” that is still given to those who seek
God with prayer and fasting. Daniel did this, and the heavenly
messenger came to him saying, “I have now come out to give you
wisdom and understanding . . . therefore consider the word and
understand the vision” (Dan. 9:22–23). Light is needed, and light will
surely be given, all the light that we require for these dark days, if we
prize it enough to seek it as he did.
The promise given long ago to those who keep God’s chosen fast
is still true:
“Then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be
as the noonday. And the Lord will guide you continually, and
satisfy your desire with good things, and make your bones
strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of
water, whose waters fail not.” (Isa. 58:10–11)

### Fleshpots of Egypt

*Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt,*
*when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the full.*
Exodus 16:3
t is said that the quickest way to a man’s heart is through his
stomach. Evidently Satan thought that that was equally true for a
woman, for it was Eve he tempted with the forbidden fruit. “So
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food . . . she took of
its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate”
(Gen. 3:6). So it was, among other things, a temptation to eat that
encompassed the ruin of the race. The cry of man’s stomach helped
to drown the voice of God in the garden of Eden.
Satan found he could make a strong appeal to the human
stomach, and in the millenniums that followed, he has pursued this
line with obvious success. Even Noah, a man who walked with God,
fell into the trap. “He planted a vineyard; and he drank of the wine,
and became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent” (Gen. 9:20–21).
In his old age we find Isaac, the patriarch, despite what God had
revealed to him, favoring Esau rather than Jacob, and for no nobler
reason than the fact that this elder son supplied his father’s table
with the food that he liked (Gen. 25:28). Esau in turn sold his
birthright for a single meal, and for this he later forfeited also the
blessing of the firstborn (Heb. 12:16–17). To what extent was Esau’s
carnality to be laid at the door of his aged father, who did not
discipline his own appetites? It is a challenging question for Christian
parents.
The sad story of God’s people in their wilderness wanderings
reveals a continuous record of failure along this line. Over the matter
of food, they murmured, they wept, they craved, they lusted.
“Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of
Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the full”
(Exod. 16:3).
“O that we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in
Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the
onions, and the garlic” (Num. 11:4–5).

---

“Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe
this worthless food [the manna]” (21:5).
God’s attitude in all this is brought out vividly by the psalmist:
He gave them what they craved. But before they had sated
their craving . . . the anger of God rose against them and he
slew the strongest of them, and laid low the picked men of
Israel. (Ps. 78:29–-31)
He gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease
among them. (106:15)
This lust for food even reared its head in the sanctuary of God,
and brought a curse upon the house of Eli. God asked the aged
priest with indignation, “Why then look with greedy eye at my
sacrifices and my offerings which I commanded, and honor your
sons above me by fattening yourselves upon the choicest parts of
every offering of my people Israel?” (1 Sam. 2:29).
Though God has given us our bodies and planted within them
certain basic instincts, including the bodily appetites, we are required
to keep the physical subservient to the spiritual. The body is ever to
be our servant, not our master. That lust for food displayed by Israel
in the wilderness is still with us. If, as Paul tells us, God was
displeased with His lusting people then, and overthrew them in the
wilderness (1 Cor. 10:5), why should we think that He is any more
pleased with His lusting people today?
For each believer there is a finely drawn line between the
satisfying of the normal desires of the body and satisfying that inner
demanding spirit, that bondage to a fleshly craving, which is not
removed because we try to camouflage it. When we cannot say “no”
to the second helping of the food we like, though we do not need it;
when we are forever having “snacks” between regular meals; when
we crave special foods that tickle the palate and appeal to our
fastidious appetites; when, in a word, food is an everpresent
temptation to which we constantly yield—then it is clear we are in
bondage.
“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All
things are lawful for me,” but I will not be enslaved by
anything. “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for

---

food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. (1 Cor.
6:12–13)
For whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved. (2
Pet. 2:19)
Paul had some hard things to say to the undisciplined believers
at Corinth where such evils as drunkenness and gluttony were seen
in their love feasts, so that it became impossible to observe the
Lord’s Supper (1 Cor. 11:20–22). He reminded them concerning the
history of Israel in the wilderness:
Now these things are warnings for us, not to desire evil as
they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is
written, “The people sat down to eat and drink.” (1 Cor. 10:6–
7)
Sitting down to eat and drink—and the Holy Spirit calls it idolatry!
We are not suggesting that the God who gives us richly all things to
enjoy cannot bless our feasting as well as our fasting. The fact
remains that the Holy Spirit is here warning us that our sitting down
to eat and drink can be idolatry, just as it can be to the glory of God.
There has been too much indiscipline in this realm among professing
Christians to allow us to think that we do not need this apostolic
injunction.
It is a sobering thought that all the sin and sorrow, sickness and
death in the world today stemmed, in the first instance, from tasting
the forbidden fruit. But God be praised that in the fullness of time
there stepped into the arena another Man, “the last Adam.” He met
the attack of the same tempter, not in the perfect environment of
paradise, but in a desolate wilderness; not well nourished by the
bounteous provision of Eden, but with a body weakened by
prolonged fasting and gripped by intense hunger:
And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of
God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” But
he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” . . .
Then the devil left him (Matt. 4:3-11).
Where the first Adam failed, the last Adam triumphed. Through
His death and resurrection, He has restored to man the paradise he
had lost through sin. John sees at last the tree of life, from which

---

man had been driven by his disobedience, growing on either side of
the crystal river in the city of God. He tells us of the eternal
blessedness of those who wash their robes and so have right to the
tree of life, who enter by the gates into the city (Rev. 22). Man, shut
out from the paradise of Eden, is restored at last to the paradise of
God, through the obedience of the Man, Christ Jesus.
In the meanwhile we have to live in a body subject to temptation.
“Eating and drinking,” Christ warned us, would mark the days prior to
His return, just as they had marked the days of Noah. He told us to
watch lest our hearts be overtaken with surfeiting (indulgence) and
drunkenness and the cares of this life, and the day of His return find
us unprepared (Matt. 24:37–38; Luke 12:45–46; 21:34). His disciples
must say no to self, take up the cross and follow Him. What part
does fasting play in the disciplining of our bodies? That is a question
we must now consider.

### To Buffet the Body

*I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself*
*should be disqualified. 1 Corinthians 9:27*
here are those who are seemingly oblivious to their bondage to
food and to the fact that there is here a leakage of spiritual
power. They mistake the lust that enslaves them for a natural
and healthy appetite. Others are aware but show no alarm that they
are slaves of the stomach. The truth that Christian discipleship
involves self-discipline in this realm has evidently not penetrated
their conscience. Their desire and capacity for food is a big joke. “I
can resist anything but temptation,” they say.
Many who have fasted would admit that it was the call of God to
abstain that found them out. As Martin Luther, an inveterate faster,
quaintly expressed it, “the flesh was wont to grumble dreadfully.”
In his biography of Rees Howells to which we have already
referred, Norman Grubb records how God first dealt with His servant
along this line:
It was at a time when he had a great burden for a certain
convention, which was being disrupted by assaults of the
enemy. The Lord called him to a day of prayer and fasting,
which was something new to him. Used, as he was, to a
comfortable home and four good meals a day, it came as a
shock to realize that it meant no dinner, and he was agitating
about it. And would it only happen once? Supposing God
asked him to do it every day!
When midday came he was on his knees in his bedroom,
but there was no prayer that next hour. “I didn’t know such a
lust was in me,” he said afterwards. “My agitation was the
proof of the grip it had on me. If the thing had no power over
me, why did I argue about it?”
At one o’clock his mother called him, and he told her he
wasn’t taking lunch. But she called again, as a mother would,
and urged, “It won’t take you long to have it.” The goodly
aroma from downstairs was too much for him, and down he
came. But after the meal, when he returned to his room, he

---

couldn’t get back into the presence of God. He came face to
face with disobedience to the Holy Ghost.
“I felt I was like the man in the garden of Eden. I went up
the mountain and walked miles, cursing that old man within
me.” . . . He didn’t take dinner for many days after that, but
spent the hour with God. As he said later, “The moment I got
victory in it, it wasn’t a very big thing to do. . . . It is while you
still want a thing that you can’t get your mind off it. When you
have risen above it, He may give it back to you; but then you
are out of it.”1
Where there is a failure to deal with this lust for food, the life is
opened to attack along other lines. The connection between
overeating and the stimulating of sex desire is common knowledge.
The sin of Sodom, as we have already observed, was linked with
“surfeit of food.” God said of Israel, “When I fed them to the full, they
committed adultery” (Jer. 5:7). Earlier He had warned them through
Moses that their possession of the land flowing with milk and honey
after the wilderness wanderings would bring new temptations—the
temptation to rebel against God, to forsake Him for idols:
“But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked; you waxed fat, you grew
thick, you became sleek; then he forsook God who made him,
and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation. They stirred him to
jealousy with strange gods; with abominable practices they
provoked him to anger” (Deut. 32:15–16).
Paul insisted on the importance of disciplining the bodily
appetites and not making “provision for the flesh, to gratify its
desires” (Rom. 13:14). Referring to the marriage relationship, he
encourages periods of abstinence and then “come together again” (1
Cor. 7:5). In the verse at the head of our chapter, borrowing his
figure from the gymnasium or training ground, which was an
important feature of every Greek city, the apostle reveals something
of his own inner discipline:
Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. . . . I pommel
my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself
should be disqualified (1 Cor. 9:25–27).
To the mind of the apostle, there was not merely the danger of
temptation, if the body was not buffeted, but of loss of power in the

---

great contest of life, just as an athlete who failed to train seriously
would be hampered on the day of the race and lose the prize. He
therefore made it his business to take what practical steps should be
necessary to subdue the appetites and desires of the body, that the
spiritual might be kept in the ascendancy. How could he expect to
win the wreath of the conqueror while continually conquered by his
own insatiable appetites?
In the days of His flesh, our Lord and Savior knew what it was to
be hungry and thirsty and weary, but He ever displayed that perfect
self-control which is the fruit of the Spirit. Arriving in the heat of the
day at Sychar’s well, He ministered living water to a sinful woman
while His disciples went off in search of food. Returning with their
provisions, they urged Him to eat, certain that He must be as
famished as they were. Quickly He replied, “I have food to eat of
which you do not know.” Had someone come in their absence and
brought Him something? “My food,” He explained, “is to do the will of
him who sent me, and to accomplish his work” (John 4:8, 31–34).
What perfect mastery of the physical by the spiritual! But had He
not fasted forty days and forty nights? Had He not repulsed the
tempter’s attack when urged to turn stones into bread? Man is not to
live by bread alone, but sometimes he may have to live by the word
of God alone. Was not the life of Him who “pleased not himself” one
of perpetual self-discipline? Does He not still call us to follow Him in
the path of self-denial and cross-bearing? But how is it to be done?
“It is a perfectly simple matter,” someone replies. “The fruit of the
Spirit is self-control. Let Jesus live His life in you, and this fruit will be
the sure result.” This, of course, is the truth, but it is not the whole
truth, as many have had to learn through the discipline of failure.
There are often outward and practical steps God requires us to take
before this fruit can be produced.
We are indeed to “put on the Lord Jesus Christ” by faith, but we
are also to “make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires”
(Rom. 13:14). It is essential that “we know that our old self was
crucified with him” (Rom. 6:6) nearly two millenniums ago, but the
nails of the cross do not absolve us from the need of disciplining the
appetite. The New Testament Epistles are careful to emphasize this
latter aspect as well as the former: “Shun youthful passions” (2 Tim.

---

2:22); “renounce . . . worldly passions” (Titus 2:12); “abstain from the
passions of the flesh” (1 Pet. 2:11).
This idea of a self-imposed discipline is basic to the whole biblical
concept of fasting. We have already noted that the only fast
*prescribed by the Law was the Day of Atonement. “You shall afflict*
yourselves” (Lev. 23:27), was the way God described it. Thus, in the
abortive fasting described in Isaiah 58, Israel asks querulously, “Why
have we fasted, and thou seest it not? Why have we humbled
ourselves [lit., afflicted ourselves] and thou takest no knowledge?”
David also records, “I afflicted myself with fasting” (Ps. 35:13).
The value of fasting as an aid to subduing the body and
mastering the appetite has always been recognized. The Church of
England Homily (1562) suggests that the first end of fasting is “to
chastise the flesh, that it be not too wanton, but tamed and brought
in subjection to the spirit.”
This principle is well illustrated in the life of the early Wesleyan
preacher, William Bramwell:
He saw the possibility that, after having preached to others,
himself might become a castaway. By stated fasting, by
constant watchfulness, by habitual temperance in all things,
he kept the body in subjection, and thereby increased his
spirituality and power.
Writing to a friend in Liverpool in 1809 he said:
The reason why the Methodists in general do not live in this
salvation is, there is too much sleep, too much meat and
drink, too little fasting and self-denial, too much conversation
with the world, too much preaching and hearing, and too little
self-examination and prayer.
One might easily imagine he was referring to the evangelical
church of the latter-twentieth century. Men like Bramwell are a
standing rebuke to our easy, affluent age. What a need there is for
us to watch and pray and fast, if we are to keep under our bodies,
conserve our spiritual power and win the victor’s crown!

### What About Asceticism?

*Why do you submit to regulations, “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not*
*touch”. . . according to human precepts and doctrines? These have*
*indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting rigor of devotion and self-*
*abasement and severity to the body, but they are of no value in checking*
*the indulgence of the flesh. Colossians 2:20–23*
erhaps we are wondering if all this emphasis upon fasting,
disciplining the body and so on, may not lead to an unhealthy
asceticism, or even fanaticism. It is this fear that lies behind
much of the traditional attitude to fasting in most evangelical circles.
It is a reaction to extremism. Most of us are extremists or
reactionaries. In leaning over backwards to avoid the excesses of
the extremist, the reactionary falls into the opposite error, and
becomes an extremist in reverse. It is not easy to strike the happy
spiritual balance of Scripture.
What is asceticism? It is derived from a Greek word meaning
“practice or training for the attainment of an ideal or goal,” and was
applied to soldiery, athletics and learning, as well as virtue and
piety.1 This agrees with the New Testament, and in this sense our
Lord Himself, the apostles and every disciplined Christian could be
called “ascetic.”
Asceticism, however, soon developed features that were
erroneous and harmful, and this is why the word carries with it the
stigma of extremism in the minds of most people. This is apparent
even in the dictionary definition of “ascetic” as “pertaining to the
exercise of extremely rigorous self-discipline.”2
We may distinguish three stages which marked the development
of the ascetic spirit in the Christian church. First, there was the
periodic and controlled abstention from gratifying the legitimate
appetites of the body. Where the motive is right and the method
scriptural, this can only result in good, and fasting unto God is an
obvious example of it.
Then there was the renunciation of all physical comforts and of
normal social intercourse, exemplified by the hermit or monk.3 The
final stage was the self-infliction of various forms of bodily torture,
such as wearing a hair shirt or a spiked girdle.

---

The ascetic spirit, including fasting, is not, of course, peculiar to
medieval Christianity. It is found in most primitive religions from the
Eskimos of Alaska to the Aborigines and Maoris of Australasia.4 It
was especially common in oriental religions, for example, the Fakirs
and naked ascetics of Hinduism. In the development of the ascetic
spirit, whether in the Christian or the pagan world, we can discern
the master mind of Satan seeking to pervert man’s religious instincts.
Behind the erroneous practices of medieval asceticism was
erroneous doctrine. There was a false view of God as One who
takes pleasure in pain, suffering and hardship. Are there not those
today who assume that the hard path must of necessity be the will of
God? “Master, I knew you to be a hard man” (Matt. 25:24)
summarizes the wrong concept many have of their heavenly Father.
Jesus reminded the Pharisees that God would have mercy and not
sacrifice.
Then it involves a false view by man of himself, that he can by
the rigors of self-mortification atone for his sins or acquire merit with
God. This led to the doctrine of penance, and the atoning for sin by
“satisfactions” and “merits.” Here lurks that insidious pride which
glories in its own readiness to embrace suffering instead of glorying
in the cross. The one “full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation,
and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world”5 needs not to be
supplemented by any human suffering.
Finally, there is the wrong attitude to the human body, that it is
inherently and incorrigibly evil. Thus, it is deemed necessary, in
order to secure the purity of the soul, to free it from all dependence
on the body by subjecting that body to rigorous self-discipline.6 Did
the body crave sex expression? This must be ruthlessly repressed
by a vow of celibacy. Did it crave sleep? This must be strictly curbed,
and so the tolling bell in the night watches dragged the monks from
their cells for their vigil of prayer. Did the body crave the comforts of
life? Let it be subjected to all manner of hardship, even tortured, for
its many sins.
In the monastic system which commenced about the end of the
third century, we see the outworking of these false views. There was
the solitary monk or hermit, and there was the social who lived in a
fraternity where ascetic principles were rigorously enforced. In some

---

communities absolute silence was the rule, and the monks slept in
their goatskin clothing in a sitting posture, and declined all ablutions.
Fasting was one of the first things to come under the influence of
a rigid and demanding asceticism in the early centuries of the
Christian era. Formalism was the thin end of the wedge, while a
misguided and intemperate zeal was not wanting to drive it home.
Neither Christ nor His apostles laid down any rules for fasting. It was
a personal matter between the disciple and his Master, in the light of
needs and circumstances. With the decline of vital Christianity,
increasing emphasis was placed upon the outward rather than the
inward. The form of godliness replaced the power, and men tried to
be wiser than the All-wise by supplying rules of fasting which they
had failed to find in Scripture.
One fast a year, on the Day of Atonement, was all that the Law
had prescribed. But by the time of Zechariah, there were at least four
a year (Zech. 8:19), and when our Lord came on the scene, the
Pharisees were observing two a week. The history of the church
shows a similar trend. What was at first a matter of individual
conscience became a matter of custom, such as the practice of
fasting each Wednesday and Friday; this in turn became a matter of
obligation. Manuals of instruction, based on supposed apostolic
authority, brought this and many other matters under rule. “The
growth of strictness in fasting is especially observable in the 4th
century, the age of councils and organization, made possible by the
cessation of persecution.7
We are now living in a day of selfish ease and comfortable
affluence. Wherever God is pleased to move by His Spirit, there is
the danger of a sharp reaction to this easygoing spirit which could
quickly lead to an unscriptural asceticism. This tendency lies
dormant in the human breast and only waits the right conditions—a
zeal which is not according to knowledge and a pride of superior
devotedness—to burst into flames.
There is nothing essentially vile in the human body, for God
created it, even with its desires and appetites. There is nothing evil in
a hungry man’s desire for a square meal, or a healthy woman’s
longing for a husband, children and a home of her own. It is not the
way of the Spirit to repress these natural instincts, but to control

---

them and keep them within the bounds prescribed by God. We do
not need to extinguish the fire in the grate; only to prevent the coals
from falling out and setting the place on fire. The physical is not to be
ruthlessly suppressed but firmly disciplined and subordinated to the
spiritual.
When asceticism becomes a thing of form enforced by man-
made rules, it is incapable of dealing effectively with the bodily lusts.
Self-control on the other hand is the fruit of the Spirit, springing from
divine life within, cultivated by the habit of a disciplined life.
Why do you submit to regulations, “Do not handle, do not
taste, do not touch” . . . according to human precepts and
doctrines? These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in
promoting rigor of devotion and self-abasement and severity
to the body, but they are of no value in checking the
indulgence of the flesh.
Wesley declared, “Some have exalted religious fasting beyond all
Scripture and reason; and others have utterly disregarded it.7 In
studiously avoiding the one, let us watch against the other. The
much more prevalent error of our day is an easy indulgence which
permits us to pamper the flesh when we should buffet it; to feast and
enjoy ourselves when we ought to fast and to pray.
Note: The influence of early asceticism on the text of the New
Testament is suggested by the inclusion of references to fasting in
four passages in the King James Version which are now thought to
be interpolations. See Appendix I.

*The Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press.*
*Greek, asketes, from the same root as “ascetic.”*
*J. Hastings, ed.,Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (article on*
fasting).

This opposition of soul and body is called “dualism.” Notice how the
*revisers ably altered Philippians 3:21, “our vile body” to “the body of*
our humiliation.”

### Fasting and the Body

*The body is . . . for the Lord. . . . Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. .*
*. . So glorify God in your body. 1 Corinthians 6:13–20*
n this and the next few chapters, we shall be dealing mainly with
the longer fast and its effect upon the body, though there is much
here we need to understand even if we never fast for longer than a
day.
Anyone called to undertake a prolonged fast must not be
surprised if well-meaning relatives greet the discovery with a look of
dismay. This is usually followed by many plausible arguments
calculated to dissuade the would-be faster from the dire and dreadful
consequences of his foolish course! Sometimes this can be a more
formidable barrier than the inevitable discouragements that come
from within.
Behind a good deal of the opposition to the protracted fast are
the common misconceptions that we must keep eating to live; that
fasting is starving; that it is dangerous if not positively injurious.
These fears are based on ignorance of a few well-proven facts
regarding the activity of the human body during the fasting process.
Food is of course necessary for the sustaining of life, but air,
water and sleep are much more urgently needed. The body cannot
live more than a few minutes without air, or a few days without water
and sleep; but in normal circumstances it can exist quite
satisfactorily for several weeks without food.
Just as the camel has been designed to carry a water cistern
within its body, enabling it to traverse the burning deserts, so God
has equipped the human body with its own “built-in pantry.”
A normally healthy and well-nourished body can exist for several
weeks without being injured or incapacitated by lack of food. During
a prolonged fast the body is living on surplus fat, and at the same
time it is acting like an internal incinerator, burning up the waste and
decaying tissues of the body. Only when this refining process is
complete does it commence to consume its sound living cells, and
that is when starvation begins.
How, then, is one to know when this point is reached? We may
usually distinguish three phases through which the body passes

---

during a long fast (though they are not always clearly defined but
tend to overlap, and the duration of each varies greatly with the
individual). The first phase is marked by a craving for food, which
may last for a couple of days or longer. Once it passes, though there
may continue to be a pleasurable sensation at the thought of food,
there is no craving or strong temptation.
The second phase is marked by a feeling of weakness and
faintness which may last for two or three days or even much longer.
At this point every movement of the body seems to require an effort
of the will. In many respects this is the most difficult part of the fast,
and some may find it necessary to rest a good deal. The gradual
disappearance of this sense of weakness is a signal that the body
has eliminated its grosser wastes and poisons.
The third and easiest is the one of growing strength, with little or
no concern about food, and only occasional and decreasing spasms
of weakness. At this stage the person fasting often feels he could
continue his fast indefinitely without any great effort.
The termination of this final phase is marked by the beginning of
hunger pangs, showing that the process of elimination has been
completed and now the body is beginning to draw on the sound
living tissue. The appearance of hunger is thus the warning bell
announcing that the body is beginning to starve. In certain cases this
may occur as early as the twenty-first day, but very often it is not till
the fortieth day, or even long after. From the commencement of the
*fast till hunger returns is sometimes called the complete fast.*
We read of our Lord, that “he fasted forty days and forty nights,
*and afterward he was hungry” (Matt. 4:2). It is significant that the*
*Scripture does not record that He hungered during the forty-day fast*
but at the conclusion of it. This is in exact accordance with what we
know of the fasting process, and is thus one of the many incidental
testimonials to the truth of the inspired record. Our Lord had clearly
accomplished a complete fast, all the reserves of the body had been
expended, and starvation was setting in. It was at this point He faced
the personal encounter with Satan, and the temptation to turn stones
into bread.
It is important for us to distinguish between a desire or appetite
for food and a hunger for food. It is doubtful whether the average

---

individual reared in our well-fed Western civilization knows much of
genuine hunger. The sensation of emptiness or weakness, of
gnawing in the pit of the stomach and other symptoms experienced
at the outset of a fast are seldom real hunger. They are a craving for
food resulting from the long-continued habit of feeding ourselves
three times a day without intermission for three hundred and sixty-
five days a year.
When the stomach is suddenly denied what it has been in the
habit of receiving as its right, it tends to cry out like a spoiled child
denied its after-dinner bar of chocolate. Hunger, on the other hand, is
a cry from the whole body stemming not from habit but from need.
We might say, then, that mere appetite relates to the immediate
“want” of the stomach; true hunger to the real need of the body.
It is strange that any who believe in the biblical revelation should
ever have thought that a practice so scriptural as fasting, taught and
exemplified by Christ Himself, could ever be harmful to the body,
provided it is carried out in accordance with Scripture. The fact is
that the very reverse is the case. Fasting makes possible a process
of physical therapy. It fully releases the body to operate its own
natural system of cleansing and healing.
The loss of appetite, so often the first warning of the approach of
acute illness, is thus not only a danger signal, but a signpost pointing
the way to recovery. It says in effect, “Stop eating and give your body
a chance to recover.”
The curative power of fasting has been recognized and applied
from ancient times. Plutarch, the famous biographer (ca. AD 46–120)
said: “Instead of using medicine, fast a day.” Of recent years there
has been considerable investigation of this branch of natural therapy
by qualified men both on the Continent and in the USA as well as in
Britain, and quite remarkable results have been achieved in clinics
where “the healing fast,” as it is sometimes called, is practiced.
Though the spiritual aspects of this subject are of much greater
importance, surely the needs of the body—its health and well-being
—are matters that should concern us too. Our physical condition can
often influence our spiritual lives more than we realize.
Because the bodies of believers are the temples of the Holy
Spirit, as the apostle reminds us, and because they were bought at

---

such a price, we are to glorify God in them. Is God glorified when
they are weak or sickly through neglect of the divine laws that govern
their well-being? Is God glorified when we become “casualties” in the
fight through overworking, over-feeding or undernourishing our
bodies, and failing to give them their “sabbath” of rest and
relaxation?
In an age of pressure, when the breakdown of mind or body even
among professing Christians is becoming all too familiar, the physical
value of a fast of God’s choosing becomes a matter of some
importance. Here is a divine provision for health and healing, for
renewal of mind and body, that we must further consider.

### For Health and Healing

*Beloved, I pray that . . . you may be in health. 3 John 2 Your healing shall*
*spring up speedily. Isaiah 58:8*
od has no vested interests in sickness and infirmity. We may
say that it is His general desire, as it was the apostle’s for his
friend Gaius, that His people should be in health. Exceptions to
this do not negate the general rule. If this were not the case, He
would never have equipped the human body with its own wonderful
healing powers or His church with a healing ministry.
Included in the many blessed results of God’s chosen fast is the
promise, “Your healing shall spring up speedily.” Is this a natural
healing made possible by the fast, or a supernatural healing? We
believe the promise embraces both possibilities.
Fasting, as we have already stressed, has a way of detaching us
from the world of the material so that our thinking becomes rightly
orientated, focused on God and the unseen world of which He is the
center. This inevitably results in a release of faith, which is “the
assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen”
(Heb. 11:1).
Scripture has recorded some of the mighty things God has
wrought down the years for ordinary men and women who dared to
believe Him. They have conquered kingdoms, received promises,
shut the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire and even witnessed
the resurrection of the dead (Heb. 11: 33–35). It is not therefore
surprising that, through the quickening of faith which fasting brings,
God has often supernaturally fulfilled this promise of healing.
But there is also the natural healing and rejuvenation of the body
through fasting, touched upon in the previous chapter. Here is a
natural boon of which all who fast for any reasonable length may
partake.
When David and his men were searching for the Amalekites who
had raided and burned Ziklag, they came across an Egyptian lying in
the open field. Slave to one of the Amalekites, he had fallen sick
three days before, and his master had abandoned him to die. For
three days and nights, he had had neither food nor water. After he
had been revived, he was able to tell his story, and even lead David

---

to the band he was seeking (1 Sam. 30:11–15). It would seem that
his three-day fast had healed him.
Surely no one will question that in lands where food is in plentiful
supply there are vastly more people who are ill through over-
indulgence than through undernourishment. The Edwin Smith
papyrus, estimated to be 3,700 years old, quotes an ancient
Egyptian doctor as saying: “Man eats too much. Thus he lives on
only a quarter of what he consumes. The doctors, however, live on
the remaining three-quarters.”
*From an article in Christianity Today, we have the following*
quotation from James Morrison: “There are multitudes of diseases
which have their origin in fullness, and might have their end in
fasting.”1 Without a doubt there are ills that could be cured, or better
still prevented, and a better state of general health enjoyed if fasting
coupled with reformed eating habits were practiced. Oblivious to this,
man still continues to dig his grave with his knife and fork!
Earlier we spoke of that deep spiritual purifying that should mark
the fast of consecration. This activity in the spiritual realm is being at
the same time vividly illustrated—often uncomfortably so—in the
physical realm. The purging of the soul is reflected in the purging of
the body. The deposits of surplus fat, the waste material and the
decaying tissues are being digested and eliminated.
Because there is no new intake of food, the body can no longer
engage in the work of assimilation; it therefore concentrates on the
work of elimination. Though this may be more marked in the initial
stages of a prolonged fast when there is a more rapid loss of weight,
the process continues throughout.
Dr. Buchinger, a German specialist on the healing fast, uses the
illustration of the Alaskan farmer, cut off by the winter snowdrifts, and
with fuel supplies running low, who looks around first for spare
lumber, broken furniture, old magazines and books. Then he will
have to consider what can best be sacrificed for heating purposes.
Only when all that can be spared has been burned will useful
furniture be put into the stove. He applies his analogy thus:
The more inferior the material the less compunction there is
about burning it in the fire of metabolism. Gradually, however,
after deposits of fat, impurities, and degenerated tissue have

---

been consumed, the body substance can no longer be treated
so generously. . . . The delicate inner mechanism carries out
work of amazing detail, like a surgeon operating without a
knife. In this phase dangerous and stubborn deposits are
mostly attacked. Only if the hidden corners have been
cleaned out does the organism have to approach valuable
remaining areas of flesh to maintain its metabolism while
fasting.2
At this point, of course, the fast would be broken off. Only one
who has personally experienced this process can truly sympathize
*with David when he said, “I afflicted myself with fasting” (Ps. 35:13).*
But it is no small consolation to realize that the discomforts we may
be called upon to endure in the earher stages of the longer fast are
effecting a valuable purifying of our bodies, not to mention the
spiritual benefits. This should help us in passing through the rough
water to the calmer stretch that lies beyond.
The pores of the skin, the mouth, the lungs, the kidneys, the liver
and of course the bowels are all involved, so the medical experts tell
us, in this physical spring-cleaning. The unpleasant taste in the
mouth, coated tongue and bad breath are all part of the process.
There is the familiar “fasting headache,” mostly caused by the
reaction of the body to the sudden cessation of tea and coffee— a
mild “withdrawal” symptom as the body accustoms itself to being
without the caffeine drug. Those who do not use these stimulants are
not troubled in this way. Headaches, however, may sometimes have
other causes. There is also the tendency to sleeplessness, bouts of
abdominal discomfort, nausea, dizziness, and of course weakness.
We cannot agree with those who would have us believe that
fasting is either easy or pleasant, something which our nature may
enjoy. Nor can we see anything in Scripture to suggest that God ever
intended it to be; rather the reverse. It is a physical and spiritual
medicine, and our usual verdict on such, however well the
pharmacist may sugar-coat the pill, is “unpleasant, but good for you.”
What of the general physical benefits? This cleansing process
usually produces, after a prolonged fast, a brightness of the eye,
pure breath, clear skin and a sense of physical well-being. The
digestive system should become like new. A Christian worker after

---

only a five-day fast declared, “I feel as though I’ve got a brand new
stomach.” A digestive weakness he had had for years had
disappeared.
The sense faculties of the body, especially tasting and smelling,
tend to be quickened and sharpened, while one’s mental powers
become remarkably clear and active. Whatever physical benefits
come to us as a result of fasting, it must be stressed that, in so far as
our original malaise was due to harmful habits of eating or living,
there must be reformation in these realms or the benefits will be lost.
Whether we are healthy or not, we need to get the mind of God
before undertaking any fast, especially a prolonged one. Further, we
need to have our aims and motives clear and make sure that,
whatever we may hope to gain in health and healing, the glory of
God and the spiritual issues at stake are our major concern.

### How to Begin

*Grant us the will to fashion as we feel,*
*Grant us the strength to labor as we know,*
*Grant us the purpose, ribbed and edged with steel,*
*To strike the blow.*
(John Drinkwater)
or the reader who is not content with a mere academic interest
in this subject, or a theoretical knowledge, but believes that God
now wants him to begin to put some of it into operation, we offer
some simple counsel. There are pitfalls, both in fasting and in
breaking fast, that should be avoided. We are not now dealing with
all the practical questions that arise especially with the longer fast.
We have tried to anticipate and answer these in Appendix II. For the
moment we are concerned to guide and encourage the beginner.
If you have never fasted before do not start off, as did someone
the writer once met, with a forty-day fast!—unless you are very, very
sure that God has called you to do this. The body grows accustomed
to fasting by degrees, and God does not usually ask us to run before
we have begun to walk, or even crawl. Start with a partial fast (see
chapter 4), or else fast one day till supper. Next time extend the fast
till retiring, breaking it with just a light meal or fruit only.
When you can manage a one-day fast without feeling faint or
famished (we do not say without feeling hungry!), you will be ready
for any call of God to a longer fast of three, five or seven days.
Sometimes there are spiritual, not to mention physical, purposes
accomplished by the longer fast that the shorter does not effect. But
the longer the fast you envisage, the more certain you need to be
that God has called you to it.
Beware of slavish imitation of others and what they have done,
however spiritual they may be. Beware of being carried away by
carnal enthusiasm. “Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
sins” must be our constant prayer. Remember that asceticism may
be as much “of the flesh” as overindulgence; the latter is a sin of the
body, the former of the spirit. When the Pharisees fasted, heaven
looked the other way.

---

If the fast is to be for some days, there is the temptation as it
approaches to indulge ourselves while we have the opportunity. “The
kine,” we whisper to ourselves, “were well fed and fattened before
the seven years of famine arrived!” Better far to bend our wills in
advance to the battle of self-discipline; that will ease the later
conflict.
Some advocate having fresh fruit only on the last day before
fasting, that is if the fast is to be for a number of days. Dr. Buchinger,
who advocates this, suggests that the “fruit day” ensures that the last
meal left in the bowel is fruit, which is less putrefactive than other
food residues.
It is wise to cease taking tea or coffee a few days before a longer
fast and so get over the caffeine withdrawal headache before you
start. (It is wiser still not to return to these habit-forming drinks
afterward, or at any rate to take them very weak, and in the greatest
moderation.) Other than this, the main preparation you need is one
of heart and mind.
It is of supreme importance that you approach this spiritual
exercise bearing in mind the principles unfolded in the earlier
chapters of this book, and the features that are to characterize the
fast of God’s choosing. It may help to put to yourself the following
questions:
Am I confident that this desire to fast is God-given?
Would He have me undertake a normal or just a partial fast?
*“Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness.”*
Are my motives right? Is there any hidden desire to impress others?
*“Your Father who sees in secret will reward you.”*
What are my spiritual objectives in this fast?
Personal sanctification or consecration?
Intercession? What special burdens?
Divine intervention, guidance, blessing?
The Spirit’s fullness for self or others?
To loose the captives?
To stay the divine wrath; bring revival?
*“I press on toward the goal.”*
Do my objectives tend to be self-centered? Is my desire for personal
*blessing balanced by genuine concern for others? “Let each of you*

---

*look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”*
Am I determined above all else to minister to the Lord in this fast?
*“They were worshipping the Lord and fasting.”*
You should expect that a season of fasting would prove to be for
you, as it was for your Master, a time of conflict with the powers of
darkness. Satan will often try to take advantage of your physical
condition to launch an attack. Discouragement is one of his
weapons. Guard against it by maintaining a spirit of praise.
Read through Ephesians chapter six and avail yourself of the
whole armor of God, then you will be invulnerable to Satan’s
devices. Make use especially of the shield of faith to quench all his
flaming darts. In hand-to-hand encounter, use the sword of the Spirit,
and tell Satan, “It is written . . .” Declare the victory of your great
Captain over every principality and power.
Do not make the mistake of judging the efficacy of your
intercessions by what you feel. Often in seasons of prayer and
fasting, you will find the going harder instead of easier, and will seem
to experience less rather than more liberty. This is often when most
is happening. This is wrestling. This is heavenly warfare. Your
Captain did not promise you a walk-over but a fight, and gave you
the weapons to win. Often you will not see till later the full results, but
the promise stands: “Your Father who sees in secret will reward
you.”
From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day.
(Charles Wesley)

### How to Break the Fast

*They gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to drink, and they*
*gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when*
*he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not eaten bread or drunk water*
*for three days and three nights. 1 Samuel 30:11–12*
o break a fast of only a day or two’s duration presents no
problem. It is most important, however, that we should
understand the rights and wrongs of breaking a longer fast, and
so avoid considerable pain and discomfort. This chapter, therefore,
deals with the practical side of breaking the longer fast.
The Bible reveals little of how people broke their fasts, possibly
because such matters were general knowledge in Bible times, for
fasting was common practice among peoples of other religions as
well as those of the Hebrew and Christian faiths. However, we are
left with the impression that the practical side of fasting and breaking
fast was not a complicated business. We should therefore try to keep
it as simple and natural as possible so that the emphasis may be
placed on the spiritual.
The art of breaking-fast lies in the method of bringing the body
back to its accustomed strength and the digestive organs to their
normal efficiency as smoothly and as speedily as possible. With the
awakening of hunger and the inability of the body at first to cope with
normal quantities of food, it is vitally necessary to curb and control
one’s appetite until the body is ready for full feeding. This is as great
a test of self-discipline as anything faced during the early stages of
the fast, for then the food craving was diminishing with each new
day; now it is increasing.
Because of the difficulty of this time and also because it is nearly
always necessary for the individual, once his fast is complete, to
return to his normal work as soon as possible, the “breaking-in”
period (as it is sometimes called) should not be unduly prolonged.
Unless careful dieting for health reasons is required following the
fast, there is usually no reason why one should not be able to cope
with any kind of food within seven to fourteen days after the longest
fasts, and within a week for fasts of up to twenty-one days, although
the quantity of intake will be much smaller than before the fast.

---

We do not get the impression from Scripture of any protracted
season of diet following a Bible fast and before normal life was
resumed; and there is certainly no evidence that the period of
adjustment was equivalent in length to the fast itself. To insist on this,
as some do, would inevitably mean that the fast itself has to be
unnecessarily curtailed to allow an equivalent period for returnng to
normal feeding, as the overall time that can be given up is usually
limited.
Dr. Herbert Shelton, who for years has run his own insititution for
health fasting in America, must be one of the greatest authorities on
this subject. Over the past forty-five years, he has supervised thirty
thousand fasts ranging from a few days to ninety days, and for
persons of all ages. He reckons to have a normally healthy person
back to full feeding within one week after any fast of over twenty-one
days.
Whether the period of adjustment be shorter or longer, all are
agreed that the utmost vigilance is needed. This is due to the fact
that two important things have happened to the digestive apparatus
during a prolonged fast. Firstly, the stomach has been slowly
shrinking, so that by the end of the fast it has nothing like its previous
capacity for food, and the smallest quantity of food makes one feel
surprisingly full. Secondly, the organs in the body that are usually
engaged in assimilating food have taken advantage of their holiday
by going into a kind of sleep which becomes deeper and deeper as
the fast is prolonged.
Because of these two facts, the utmost care should be exercised
*as to how much you eat, what you eat and how you eat it. The*
stomach must be given time to return to normal size, though this
may well be smaller than before the fast. The digestive organs also
must be gently and progressively caressed into wakefulness and
efficient activity. Clearly, the longer the period of hibernation, the
longer proportionately we must allow for the waking-up process.
When should a fast be broken? God will sometimes give specific
instructions about this at the time He calls us to fast. Often it is
determined by our circumstances and commitments. Otherwise, we
may expect to receive direction during the course of the fast, as in
the case recorded in the following chapter.

---

Once you know what the will of God is in this matter, beware of
the
devil’s
temptation,
usually
through
difficulties
and
discouragements, of breaking off the fast prematurely. There is one
tragic instance in Scripture of a prophet whom God entrusted with an
important mission and told to fast until he had returned from it, who
was inveigled by the enemy into breaking the fast before he should
have done so, with disastrous consequences (1 Kings 13).
One could, if necessary, break a fast on almost any kind of food,
but obviously some foods are much more suitable than others. The
two determining factors are what the body can best digest and what
will most suitably and speedily build it up generally, at any given
stage.
Almost all are agreed that a normal fast (i.e., on water only) of
some length is best broken with fruit or vegetable juices, if possible
freshly squeezed or extracted, rather than canned or bottled. Many
affirm that the citrus fruits are the best. This may well be the case in
lands where oranges and grapefruits are picked ripe. But where they
are imported the fruit is invariably picked unripe, and the juice can
often be too acidic for many stomachs. Apple, tomato or grape juice
are possible alternatives, or pure citrus juices canned from the sun-
ripe fruit.
Start at first with a small quantity, say a half tumbler, diluted if
necessary and taken every two or three hours the first day. Increase
the quantity gradually, and then you will be ready to take the fruit
itself. Milk can be included at this point, especially in the form of
yogurt, which may be taken with the fruit and is highly beneficial.
Fresh salads (without dressing), homemade vegetable soups (no
fat) and cooked vegetables may then be included in the diet, always
starting with a little of everything new and building up gradually.
A little crispbread or toasted whole-meal bread with a scraping of
butter may next be eaten with the meals, but cakes, pastries and
cookies should be avoided. Go very steady on the starchy foods at
this stage. Protein is best introduced first in the form of cheese, eggs
or nuts, with fish and meat last of all. Just how quickly you increase
your diet in variety and quantity depends on the length of your fast
and how you find the body succeeds in coping.

---

It is of the utmost importance that the food be eaten slowly, and
so masticated that it is reduced to liquid before swallowing. At the
first sensation of fullness in the stomach you should stop, even if you
haven’t completed your portion. Discomfort following a meal should
be regarded as a signal to ease off and, if necessary, miss the next
meal. This is where self-discipline is needed.
It is important to rest as much as possible during this period so as
to let the body concentrate on this business of digestion and
assimilation. Resist the temptation to become active too soon. In
Appendix II a few other practical matters relative to breaking the fast
are touched upon.
Finally, remember these golden rules:
Watch your quantities.
Eat slowly and masticate well.
Stop at the first warning sign.
Rest as much as possible.
Don’t try to do too much too soon.
We would do well at this time to give thought and prayer to our
future diet and eating habits. We will not want to return to the old
ways of undisciplined living, such as overeating, eating between
meals, or eating the wrong foods—those that appeal to the appetite
rather than those that benefit the body. Of course, we may have no
say in this. The question is, “What do I do when I have the choice?”
In any case there are several matters which we shall need to watch
besides what we eat. A few simple recommendations are given in
Appendix III.
One cannot afford to relax spiritually, only physically, during this
break-fast period. There must be constant vigilance, for “the thief”
will still be on the prowl. Beware of talking about your fast, either how
long you fasted or of experiences you may have been granted during
it, “that your fasting may be in secret,” as Christ commanded.
This should be a time of consolation, when you get right through
in prayer on matters that God has revealed to you. You may well
experience a greater release in intercession than you knew during
the fast itself. You should begin now, if not before, to see the fruit of
this time set apart for God, with blessings rebounding not only on

---

your own head but also on those for whom you have been
interceding.
This should be springtime in your soul, as well as in your body. It
is as though your Beloved is saying: “The winter is past, the rain is
over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing
has come.” New faith, new hope, new love for God and men, new
resolves to live only and utterly for His glory—all these should now
be burning on the altar of your soul, fed by the fire of intercession.
Thus, like your Lord and Master, return from your fasting
wilderness “in the power of the Spirit,” expecting that the works of
God and the graces of Christ will be manifest in you, as they were in
Him.
“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do
the works that I do, and greater works than these will he do,
because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I
will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” (John
14:12–13)

### Diary of a Fast

HE writer is indebted to a personal friend for this diary of a
twenty-one day fast. It is understood that these notes are but
extracts from his diary, for there is much that is not disclosed,
things that concerned only himself and his Lord. What has been
recorded is for the glory of God, and for our guidance and
encouragement. It was agreed that these notes should be published
anonymously.
Many of the major principles we have been considering are here
etched in life: the clarity of the guidance given; the provision of
material need during this time; the prominence given to the Word;
the spirit of praise when things were difficult physically; the deep
personal dealing with God; the emphasis on intercession; specific
answers to prayer and the physical experiences varying from day to
day.
Those who have eyes only for the sensational may be
disappointed. Whatever this contributor may have experienced of the
supernatural, he has not, with but one or two exceptions, felt led to
record. God may give unusual manifestations of His presence in
such times, but we are not to seek after these as though they were
the essential ingredient. The value of a fast is not to be judged by
how much there is of the spectacular or the dramatic, but how much
there is of solid lasting gain for the kingdom of God. According to this
principle the fast recorded here will surely rank high in the estimate
of heaven.
**Preparation**
*April 1*
The Lord is speaking to me about a prolonged time of waiting on
Him, with fasting. Therefore, I am cutting out the drinking of tea and
coffee in preparation. I need from the Lord a clear revelation of His
will for the future, a greater knowledge of Himself and the supply of
needs for God’s work which call for special intercession. Today I was
handed a book on prayer and fasting, and thanked the Lord for this
confirmation. I need to know His will when to start.
*April 2*

---

Read the book on prayer and fasting, and found it most
instructive.
*April 4*
While in prayer today, I asked the Lord when He wished me to
start the fast, and the twenty-fourth day of the month was impressed
on my heart. He will confirm.
*April 5*
In prayer today I asked God to confirm the twenty-fourth. After
prayer, went for the mail. There was a letter from R—— who wrote
saying that the Lord had impressed the twenty-fourth day of the
month on his heart and, although he did not understand why, felt he
should write to me as it may have some special significance.
Hallelujah! That confirms the date.
*April 8*
In prayer with my wife today, she mentioned a verse which had
been given to her by a friend: “Tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.”
Looked in my diary, and found that it was forty days from April the
twenty-fourth until Whit Monday. The Lord spoke to me today
through my reading in Ezekiel 3:24–27: “Then the spirit entered into
me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me,
Go, shut thyself within thine house. But thou, O son of man, behold,
they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and
thou shalt not go out among them: and I will make thy tongue cleave
to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to
them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. But when I speak
with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that
forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.”
The Spirit witnessed this to me. The waiting time has to be here
at home. The remaining scriptures are so relevant to present
circumstances.
*April 23*
The Lord spoke to me today through Daniel 10:12: “For from the
first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
thyself before thy God, thy words were heard.” [Here follows a list of
things which the Lord had done from April 1 in response to prayer.]
*First day (April 24)*

---

Read in Chronicles about Solomon determining to build,
beginning the building and finishing the work. This is the day of
beginning. Got through a lot of work and study and waiting upon the
Lord. A—— called with a sack of potatoes, large box of groceries
and £25 cash. How wonderfully kind of the Lord to supply this loving
provision for the family. Several callers and a number of phone calls.
Drank about six cups of warm water. Feeling well. Went to bed at
10:00 p.m.
*Second day*
Intercession today for many things [listed in diary] and for the
country of ____. Many thoughts given from the Word. Had five
people call at various times for counsel, etc. Hunger at times. Drank
eight glasses of water. Worked for twelve hours and then had time
with some who called. Woke in night with some discomfort but on the
whole slept well.
*Third day*
Much time in waiting on the Lord, and intercession and in the
Word. Several people called. Much work done.
Feelings of weakness with occasional pangs of hunger. Body
feels the cold in an increased way. Drank fair quantities of water, hot
and cold.
*Fourth day*
Much happened today in contact with others which is a fulfillment
of what the Lord indicated some time ago. Wonderful how the Lord is
sending people in these days and to see Him outworking His plans.
Much blessed in going through the Sermon on the Mount. Listed all
the instructions Jesus gave for us to obey. Liberty in prayer.
More feeling of physical discomfort and feeling the cold very
much. No real hunger pangs. Cooked breakfast for the family without
temptation!
*Fifth day*
*In the Word and prayer. Read Dr. Tozer’s Wingspread, biography*
of A.B. Simpson, a man who had to walk the path of “no reputation,”
but God through him founded one of the greatest missionary
societies, The Christian and Missionary Alliance.
Most uncomfortable day as yet, with backache and general
feeling of weakness and nausea. Must all be part of the internal

---

process of breaking up of toxins, etc. Also found it more difficult to
absorb mentally, but the Lord is my strength.
*Sixth day*
Another day of work, waiting on the Lord and intercession. X
telephoned to get right with me on something he had done, because
of the fear of man. The Lord bless him—He always does bless the
humble. The servant of the Lord must not strive—God outworks His
wonderful purposes—we have the key—prayer.
Still discomfort and weakness today, but count it all joy as this is
all in the plan.
*Seventh day*
Although there is liberty in prayer, I know there is a much deeper
place in intercession to be reached. In response to prayer I believe
the Lord is sending in the amounts for the work. A. called this
afternoon and we had two hours’ fellowship together with a weeping
before the Lord in prayer and intercession.
A general improvement physically. A few periods of weakness
and feeling of heaviness. Since commencement of fast have had no
headaches. Noticeable loss of weight.
*Eighth day*
Spent much of the day in matters related to the work, and in
*prayer. Read the booklet, What Really Happened at Azusa Street,*
the story of the movings of the Holy Spirit at the beginning of the
century in America. Five friends called this evening, and we had a
wonderful time together in the Lord’s presence. Interceded for some
in great need, and for the country. The Lord’s presence was very,
very real. Certain gifts of the Spirit were in operation.
A
definite
change
today
physically,
and
feeling
of
restrengthening. Continue daily to drink fair amounts of water.
Cannot say there is no desire for food, but there is no craving for it.
*Ninth day*
Great liberty in worship, and much brokenness as the Holy Spirit
gave a glimpse of the sufferings of the Lord. “What are these
wounds in thine hands?” He was wounded for my transgressions.
How terrible is sin. I want a greater hatred of it.
More alert mentally today, and feeling much stronger, with lapses
of weakness.
*Tenth day*

---

Deep heart searchings today, and revelation of the deceitfulness
of the heart. Praise God for the blood of Christ. Much work done.
Several callers. X called, and he was released. God is answering
prayer. A—— also called for prayer—the Lord is sending people.
Increase in strength. Drinking about five or six glasses of water daily,
mostly warm water.
*Eleventh day*
Another day of intercession for the nation and for the work in
other lands. A—— called again today, and we had a precious time in
prayer. S—— and I sought the Lord together in the evening with
much liberty.
Feeling very much stronger. Body thin, but heart filled with His
goodness. Having about eight hours’ sleep each night.
*Twelfth day*
Much is happening in these days in fulfillment of what God has
said in Ezekiel and also in God’s original call to me some years ago:
“They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee,
for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.” Grateful when we
can lovingly pray for those who speak against us. “We rest on Thee,
our Shield and our Defender.” A—— called again, and we spent time
in prayer together. Read Daniel, and the Lord spoke to me relative to
Daniel’s fast of twenty-one days. Know I have to spend forty days set
apart to seek the Lord; the length of the fast He will show. Willing for
all that He reveals.
Physically this has been the best day yet—feeling strong,
continuing to drink six or more glasses of water per day.
*Thirteenth day*
The emphasis is on waiting on the Lord. After Daniel had fasted
for three weeks, the revelation came to him of that which should
befall the people in the last days. Seeking His will for the furtherance
of the work in the country of ____.
The Lord is faithfully meeting every need. Increasing strength, no
discomfort. Praise the Lord.
*Fourteenth day*
Letter received today from the country of ____. Been praying for
this land and here is an answer toward the future. Blessed by
*reading Andrew Murray’s Waiting on God.*

---

Physically a good day again. No feeling of weakness. Weighed
myself—have lost twenty pounds in fourteen days.
*Fifteenth day*
Good day’s work. Two friends called, and we had a profitable
time in prayer and discussion. Wonderful to see the answers to
prayers in matters for which we are interceding. Almost daily the
Lord sends gifts toward the work of outreach.
Seem to be on an even keel. No weakness, occasional feeling of
discomfort but only for very brief periods.
*Sixteenth day*
Much work and study done today. How precious is the Word of
God, and what a blessed teacher the Holy Spirit is! Reading of the
ministries of John the Baptist and Elijah. How we need the voices
crying in the wilderness today and pointing to the Lamb of God.
Routine today.
*Seventeenth day*
Day of prayer for the needs of the work. Had a specific financial
need. The Lord sent someone this evening with amount to meet the
need, praise the Lord. It is no vain thing to wait on the Lord and trust
Him. Real concern in prayer for this nation—like Daniel’s mourning
for a nation. Slight discomfort today and felt a bit lethargic at times,
but so much for which to praise Him for His sustaining grace. This is
not an endurance test, but a wonderful experience of the all-
sufficiency of our God.
*Eighteenth day*
Praise the Lord for another day to experience His strength. The
Lord sent over £200 for the work. Very much liberty in prayer and
intercession.
A good day physically.
*Nineteenth day*
Continually impressed by Daniel’s fast of twenty-one days. The
Lord will show. Much blessed in the reading of the Word in
Chronicles and Luke’s Gospel. X called again today, and we sought
the Lord together. So much appreciated this fellowship in these days.
*He brought me Watchman Nee’s The Normal Christian Church Life.*
How we need a new vision of Christ and His church.
Good day. One feels that one could continue fasting for many
days if called to do so. No desire for food whatsoever. Continue to

---

drink about six glasses of warm water a day. Who said that water
was tasteless?
*Twentieth day*
Much impressed in reading of the rich man in Luke 12 today, with
the lesson of the parable: “So is he that layeth up treasure for
himself, and is not rich toward God.” “Thou fool”— God help us to be
rich toward Him. Further answers to prayer. A—— called again today
for prayer fellowship. D—— called and in conversation asked
questions on Daniel 10. He knew nothing of my thoughts on this
chapter which mentions the twenty-one day fast, but believe the
mention of it was from the Lord.
Routine, apart from a very brief time of slight dizziness. Feeling
strong.
*Twenty-first day*
Gracious words from the Lord through First Chronicles 22:11–19.
Believe He would have me terminate the fast tomorrow. He knows
the program He has arranged for me next month. I—— called today
from W——. Good prayer fellowship together.
**Breaking the Fast**
*First day*
Rose at 2:00 a.m. to read and pray. Sought the Lord’s
confirmation about ending the fast. He gave His peace as His
confirmation. Returned to bed, and in the morning the Lord gave
another confirmation of His will. Busy day—more answers to prayer.
Deep intercession with cryings for this nation.
Broke fast by drinking a little apple and orange juice, diluted with
water, and also some tomato juice. NO solids.
*Second day*
Believe the last three weeks have been a preparation for this day.
As I waited on the Lord, He gave me a great burden for this nation,
also a vision of a great burning mountain, and out of the bowels of
this mountain came forth the judgments of God. Cried to God for
mercy upon this country, pleading that He would withhold His
judgments until revival came. Know the Lord heard. Cannot describe
in words what this day has been. He is the God who heareth prayer
—a God of mercy.
Drank fruit juices today. Feeling very strong and mentally very
alert.

---

The return to a full and normal diet was gradual. It was many
weeks before I was back to normal weight, but physically there was
no deterioration, but an improvement in health.
**In Retrospect**
The purpose of the fast was not so much to receive but to give, in
waiting on God in prayer and intercession. The main purpose was to
intercede for the country of ____ and for gospel outreach to another
nation. Sufficient to know His purposes fulfilled, reward enough to
know the joy of His presence and fellowship with the Lord.
One can now see that since those days of prayer and fasting
there has been an ever-increasing ministry of deliverance for others,
and at times a new authority in the preaching of the Word. New
doors to nations were opened for ministry, and there has been an
enlargement in prayer and intercession. However, one cannot go on
looking back but must live one day at a time, “looking unto Jesus, the
author and finisher of our faith.” Fasting and prayer was part of the
life of our Lord while here on earth, and “he that saith he abideth in
Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.”

### In the Last Days

*I will pour out of my spirit. Joel 2:28*
*I will build my church. Matthew 16:18*
*I will come again. John 14:3*
o cooperate with God in the outworking of His plan demands an
understanding of that plan. There are three realms of truth
which, perhaps more than any others, have been storm centers
of controversy among earnest Christians: the doctrine of the Spirit,
the doctrine of the church and the doctrine of Christ’s second advent
(with associated events). This is not surprising if, as we believe,
these doctrines hold the vital keys to God’s world program. Satan
cannot afford to see these keys drop into the hands of the church
without a fight, for they spell destruction to the kingdom of darkness.
The divisive tactics of Satan, however, cannot thwart the purpose of
God.
It is deeply significant that in recent years there has been a
worldwide resurgence of interest in the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
and especially the pouring out of the Spirit in revival power. But this
has forced many thinking people to make a fresh appraisal of their
doctrine of the church. If we are to have the new wine of the Spirit,
what about the new wineskin? In addition, the swiftly moving
ecclesiastical situation, dominated by ecumenism, is sending many
back to the New Testament to reexamine God’s original plan for His
church.
What about unfulfilled prophecy and the return of Christ?
Widespread interest in this aspect of truth is yet to come. Let us now
see how these three vital keys to God’s plan are also closely
associated with the subject of fasting.
**The Outpouring of the Spirit**
Many believers in these days are coming into a transforming
experience of the power and gifts of the Holy Spirit. Many others,
convinced that a widespread visitation of the Spirit in revival power is
the only answer to the spiritual need of this hour, are pleading the
promise of Joel which Peter quoted on the day of Pentecost:
“And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour
out my Spirit upon all flesh.”

---

What shall we say about this? Did the events at Pentecost
exhaust the Joel prophecy? Obviously not, or there would have been
no further outpourings. Is, then, the final fulfillment in some future
day when the church is no longer here? Peter said it would happen
“in the last days.” Are we not now in what Scripture calls “the last
days”?
Some would say that the final fulfillment will be upon Jews only.
But the promise says “upon all flesh,” and Peter surely confirmed this
by saying, “The promise is to you and to your children [Jews] and to
all that are far off [Gentiles].” Did he not later witness the outpouring
upon the Gentiles, and dedare, “The Holy Spirit fell on them just as
on us at the beginning”? If, then, the former rain included Gentiles,
why not the latter rain?
Almost all are agreed that a visitation of the Spirit upon the
church is desperately needed. Are we to believe that the promise to
Joel has nothing to say to this situation? Are these apparently
spontaneous pleadings for the outpouring of the Spirit from all over
the world entirely misguided and out of the will of God? What, then,
is the answer to the barrenness and impotence of the church if it is
not a visitation from on high?
If, however, we believe that this wonderful promise is for us—is in
fact God’s answer to the present need—it is vital that we fulfill the
conditions as well as plead the promise. Three times Joel sounds a
clarion call, in view of the imminence of the Day of the Lord, to return
*to God with fasting (1:14; 2:12, 15). Then he seems to see in vision*
God’s response: “Then the Lord became jealous for his land, and
had pity on his people” (2:18), granting deliverance and prosperity,
followed by the outpouring of the Spirit on all flesh. Have we any
right to expect the fulfillment of this wonderful promise without
obedience to the conditions? Have we yet prayed “with all our
hearts, even with fasting”? Have tears ever been mingled with our
prayers? Have the priests, the ministers of the Lord, ever wept
between the porch and the altar? The promised outpouring calls for
fasting as well as prayer.
**The Restoration of the Church**
Some five hundred years before Christ, the exiled prophet Daniel
observed from the study of Jeremiah’s prophecy that the time was at

---

hand when God would bring His people back to Jerusalem (Dan. 9:2;
Jer. 29:10). He therefore sought God in prayer with fasting and
sackcloth and ashes, that He would fulfill the promise. Confession
mingled with his supplication as he prayed that God would cause His
face to shine upon His sanctuary which was desolate.
This fasting prayer of Daniel set the wheels in motion that led to
one of the most remarkable decrees that a heathen king ever issued.
Cyrus made a proclamation to the effect, that God had charged him
to build Him a house in Jerusalem, and that those Jews who were so
disposed were to go up to Jerusalem to rebuild the house of the Lord
(Ezra 1:14). So there came about the first return of the exiles under
Zerubbabel to rebuild the temple. Again, prayer and fasting under
the good hand of God had changed the course of history. In the later
expedition under Ezra, fasting again played its part in the safe arrival
of the exiles with their precious consignment for the house of God
(8:21–23).
Under the old covenant God had a temple for His people; under
the new God has His people for a temple. As we look out today on
the church, God’s spiritual habitation, what a need for spiritual
renewal! If the early Christians were still with us, God might well ask,
“Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How
do you see it now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?” (Hag. 2:3). The
restoration of the church to its former power and glory would involve
a transformation no less radical than that which took place in the
temple long ago under Zerubbabel and Ezra. Did not God encourage
His people with the promise, “The latter splendor of this house shall
be greater than the former”? (2:9).
The outpouring of the Spirit is not enough. The new wine must
have now, as it had when poured out on the day of Pentecost, a new
wineskin. The renewing of the house of God is indispensable. It cost
these men of the Old Testament deep intercession with fastings and
tears. Would we think to obtain it more cheaply—by consultations
and conversations and committees?
**The Return of Christ**
Neither the outpouring of the Spirit nor the reformation of the
church is our goal. It is nothing less than “the prize of the upward call
of God in Christ Jesus.” The supreme hope of the church lies in the

---

promise of the reappearance of the Lord from heaven. He told His
disciples, “I will come again.” Clearly this coming was not spiritual
but visible and literal, for as the angels informed the apostles, “This
Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the
same way as you saw him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11).
Here is the grand and glorious consummation of the age, for
which all that proceeded it was a necessary preparation. Do we long
for His return? Do we share what must be the yearning of His heart
for that coming day of vindication and coronation? When He
summons us in that day to account for our talents, will we have to
confess that the fasting talent was never used, that we hid this
precious entrustment in the ground?
Fasting, then, opens the way for the outpouring of the Spirit and
the restoration of God’s house. Fasting in this age of the absent
Bridegroom is in expectation of His return. Soon there will be the
midnight cry, “Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.” It will
be too late then to fast and to pray. The time is now.

### They Fasted

On Sinai’s mount, with radiant face,
To intercede for heaven’s grace
Upon a stubborn, wayward race,
He fasted.
Once lifted from the miry clay,
When opposition came his way
This soldier-king would often pray
With fasting.
A seer, possessed of vision keen,
Who told the troubled king his dream,
Had light on God’s prophetic scheme
Through fasting.
The prophetess in temple court
Beheld the Babe the two had brought;
For Him she long had prayed and sought,
With fasting.
He came to break the yoke of sin,
But ere His mission could begin
He met the foe and conquered him
With fasting.
“Set these apart,” the Spirit bade.
A spring, that soon vast rivers made,
Broke ope by men who as they prayed
Were fasting.
“So shall they fast when I am gone”;
Was this no word to act upon?
Ask countless saints who fought and won
With fasting.
When we shall stand on that great day
And give account, what shall we say,
If He should ask us, “Did you pray
With fasting?”
(A.W.)

### Appendix I

Doubtful References to Fasting in the King James Version
There are four verses in the New Testament where the King
James Version has a reference to fasting not endorsed by more
recent scholarship, and therefore omitted in later translations.
The following versions and translations, given in chronological
order, were consulted:
*The New Translation by J. N. Darby, 1871.*
*The Revised Version (RV), 1885.*
*The American Standard Version (ASV), 1901.*
*The New Testament in Modern Speech by R. F. Weymouth, 1902.*
*The New Translation by James Moffatt, 1913.*
*The Revised Standard Version (RSV), 1952.*
*The New Testament in Modern English by J. B. Phillips, 1958.*
*The Amplified New Testament, 1958.*
*The New Testament of the New English Bible (NEB), 1961.*
The words in doubt are in italics.
*1.   Matthew 17:21: “Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer*
*and fasting.”*
Only the translations of Darby and Weymouth include this verse.
The Amplified New Testament puts it in italics as “not adequately
supported by recent scholarship.” All the others omit the verse
completely. The IVF Commentary says: “Verse 21 is omitted by the
more reliable texts. It seems to have been interpolated from Mark
9:29.”
2. Mark 9:29: “And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by
*nothing, but by prayer and fasting.”*
The words “and fasting” are rejected by all the translations
consulted, except for Darby and Moffatt. The Amplified again uses
italics. The IVF Commentary, however, while admitting that these two
words are not found in Codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, does not
consider that the evidence against them is conclusive.
It is believed there are internal as well as textual reasons for
rejecting these words, and this applies to the parallel verse in
Matthew just considered. Fasting, we have sought to show, is not a
synonym for self-denial in the New Testament, but means abstinence
from food. Either there is a departure from the general rule in this

---

passage, so that our Lord’s words only had reference to general self-
discipline—in which case we cannot use this verse to establish
anything about literal fasting—or, if we take the word literally, His
statement conflicts with what we learn elsewhere, that Jesus did not
fast once His ministry began nor the disciples while Jesus was with
them.
Also, the introduction of the thought of fasting here obscures
what we believe was the lesson Jesus was impressing on the
disciples through their failure to set free the epileptic. It was not that
a season of prayer and fasting was necessary before this kind of
spirit could be cast out—certainly our Lord did not tarry for this—but
*that had they been living, like Him, the life of prayer, they too could*
have dealt successfully with this case. This of course does not
negate the fact that fasting is an invaluable aid to prayer in such
cases of deliverance, but this does not appear to be the point Jesus
was emphasizing.
*3. Acts 10:30: “And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting*
*until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house. . . .”*
“I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer” (RV, RSV) is how this verse
is generally rendered, only Darby supporting the inclusion of
“fasting.” Prof. F. F. Bruce on this passage draws attention to “the
pietistic addition of fasting” by an editor who “refuses to leave
*anything to the reader’s imagination” (The Acts of the Apostles, the*
Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary, Tyndale Press, 222).
4. 1 Corinthians 7:5: “Defraud ye not one the other, except it be
*with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting*
*and prayer; and come together again. . . . ”*
J.B. Phillips, oddly enough, is the only translator to support the
inclusion of “fasting” here. Dean Alford points out, under this verse in
his Greek Testament, “how such passages as this have been
tampered with by the ascetics.”

### Appendix II

*1. WHEN FASTING IS INADVISABLE: Are there some illnesses or*
*conditions that render fasting inadvisable?*
In cases of serious undernourishment or nervous exhaustion,
fasting is not recommended unless for very short periods. It should
not be undertaken by diabetic patients, especially if insulin is being
taken. Nor is it deemed advisable for expectant mothers. If there is
any doubt about fitness to fast, one should seek medical advice.
*2.   FASTING WHILE WORKING: Is it practicable to fast while carrying*
*on one’s work?*
That depends on the nature of the work, the length of the fast,
and varies to some extent with the individual. There should be no
difficulty in undertaking a day’s fast, whatever one’s occupation. One
has known of housewives and mothers who have profited from a fast
of three days or longer while running the home, preparing meals,
etc., and giving what time they could to prayer. One has known of
manual workers who have undertaken longer fasts with no ill effects,
but one would not normally recommend it. The ideal is to be as free
as possible to seek God at such a time, and to take the necessary
rest.
*3.   FASTING IF UNDERWIEGHT: Is it unwise to fast if underweight?*
According to Dr. H. Shelton, it is common to find that underweight
people recover their normal healthy weight following a longer fast.
Overfeeding and loss of weight often go together. One can eat too
much and assimilate too little if the digestive powers are impaired.
Fasting will often remedy this, so that afterward the person may eat
less, assimilate more and the weight return to normal.
*4.   AVERAGE LOSS OF WEIGHT: What is the average daily weight*
*loss during a fast?*
It varies greatly with the individual. In the first stages of a longer
fast, the graph of one’s daily loss is steeper, and then it starts to level
out. Two pounds a day, decreasing to one, would be quite average,
but overweight people may lose much more. Provided there is
sufficient rest, fasting is the safest, most efficient and certainly the
most natural weight-reducer.
*5. FASTING AND THE BOWELS: Should one use laxatives or enemas*
*while fasting?*

---

The bowel, a twisted tube some twenty-five feet long, takes on
average about twenty-four hours to discharge its contents. It is quite
common to find that after the first few days, without the stimulation of
fresh intakes of food, it ceases to function. Some recommend
Glauber’s Salts (1½ oz. in ¼ pints of warm water) on the first day of
the fast, and then periodical enemas. Laxatives are not
recommended once the fast is underway. Dr. Shelton, however,
prefers to let nature handle its own affairs without any forcing by
laxative or enema. He takes the view that if the bowels need to
operate they will; otherwise they may be more benefited by
prolonged rest. This seems to be the simpler and more natural
course, and what must have been done in Bible times. On a long fast
food residue may remain in the bowel for as long as 3 weeks, but
while there is no food intake this should not create any problem with
constipation.
In breaking a long fast, it may be some days before the bowels
start to operate. Again, it is wise to exercise patience and give them
time. Once they start they will usually function more regularly and
efficiently than before. Some people are helped by taking prunes or
figs first thing in the morning, and a daily drink of molasses.
*6.   FASTING IN WINTER: Is it advisable to fast in winter?*
While one is fasting, the fire of metabolism is being fed with low-
grade fuel and consequently not generating its usual heat. The body
therefore tends to feel the cold. Provided one is careful to keep
warm, there is no reason for not fasting in winter.
*7.   DIZZINESS: Is there any way of preventing dizziness during*
*fasting?*
This is usually a temporary symptom. It is sometimes caused by
a sudden change of position, especially sitting up from the lying
position. The remedy in that case is to move slowly.
*8.   SLEEPLESSNESS: Can one do anything about sleeplessness?*
This is sometimes due to the fact that the mind is overactive. It is
wise to avoid any concentrated mental activity before retiring, and
resist the temptation to sleep (though not to rest) during the day.
*9.   FOUL BREATH: What can be done about bad breath?*
It has been suggested that a small quantity of menthol crystals be
procured, and if one is allowed to dissolve on the tongue, it will

---

provide relief.
*10. DRINKING WATER: How much water should one drink during a*
*fast?*
Some recommend drinking as much as possible, on the
assumption that this aids the process of elimination by flushing the
system. There seems some doubt whether this is the case. Better to
let the body determine how much is drunk. Sipping water does help
stave off the craving for food and the spasms of weakness. It may be
taken hot, cold (but not chilled) or lukewarm. A slice of lemon in the
water jug will take away the metallic taste.
*11. PRACTICAL MEASURES: What other practical points should one*
*bear in mind during fasting?*
• A daily shower or bath with warm but not hot water.
• Deep breathing, concentrating on exhaling as fully as
possible.
• Regular exercise (not too strenuous), except where there is
great weakness.
*12. FALSE IMPRESSIONS: May not a person fasting be subject to*
*impressions and voices which are not from God?*
This is true. Fasting makes one sensitive to the world of spirit,
whether divine or satanic. Only if Satan already has avenues in a
person’s life will he become subject to satanic impressions when he
fasts. That these inroads should become evident in this way is often
the first step to deliverance for the person concerned. Where there
are no such avenues, we have nothing to fear, provided we remain
humble before God and are clad in the heavenly armor. God did not
design fasting to make us vulnerable to Satan.

### Appendix III

Dietetics is a vast subject outside the scope of this book.
Nevertheless, the practice of fasting tends to exercise our minds on
the matter of disciplined eating—both what we eat and how we eat it.
“Some people eat to live, and others live to eat.” Some eat with their
health in view, and others think only of their appetite. Wrong eating is
the cause of many ills. To put the thing on the highest plane, we owe
it to the God who gave us these bodies to keep them as fit as
possible to serve Him.
As to what we eat, we may be in a position where the apostolic
injunction applies: “Whatever is set before you, eat, asking no
question”! When we are able to choose, while guarding against any
tendency to become faddy or cranky over food, we should
concentrate on the health-giving foods rather than those which
merely please our appetites. This is surely included in the command
to eat and drink to the glory of God.
There is a growing tendency for man in his scientific laboratory to
think that he can imitate and even improve upon the work of nature.
This is particularly true in the food realm. So much that we eat and
drink
nowadays
is
canned,
processed,
refined,
preserved,
dehydrated, pasteurized or otherwise chemically treated—and
supposedly for our safety and good! Dr. Herbert Shelton, speaking
from the widest experience in this connection, says:
The acid test of a food, it seems to me, is its fitness to serve
the nutritive needs of the human organism just coming off a
prolonged fast. In all my experience with feeding, I have found
nothing turned out synthetically by food manufacturers to
equal the untouched products of garden, orchard and field. . .
. I emphasize the importance of eating fresh, uncooked fruits,
and vegetables daily. (From his book on fasting, p. 74.)
Finally, here are a few well-proven rules for healthy eating:
Eat to appease your hunger, and then stop. Do not go on to satisfy
your appetite.
Eat slowly and masticate well. Better leave the meal unfinished than
bolt it.
Let your mind relax. Intensive concentration, nervous tension,
emotional disturbance impair the digestion.

---

Try to develop the habit of drinking between and not during meals.
Avoid “snacks” between meals.
Avoid a heavy meal late at night. Remember your digestive organs
need rest too.
Learn what are the natural, health-giving foods, and ensure that they
constitute a good proportion of your diet.
(Your local bookseller or health food store will advise you of the
many publications now available on the subject of food reform.)
Avoid tea and coffee (there are plenty of substitutes) or else take
them in the greatest moderation. They have no nutritional value, and
as stimulants, tend to be habit-forming. “All things are lawful for me,
but I will not be enslaved by anything.”
